You can always update it manually by following these steps:Head into the \"Settings\" menuClick \"About\"Click \"Check for updates\"Click \"Relaunch\"If there is any issue with updating Overwolf please try the steps Here.Overwolf does not launch on system startup! ▾Please open Overwolf's installation directory (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Overwolf by default) and make sure that the files 'Overwolf.exe' and 'OverwolfLauncher.exe' are not set to run as an administrator:If there is still any issue please try running the Overwolf Troubleshooter.CompatibilityWhat are Overwolf's minimum requirements? ▾Operating System: Minimum: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)*Windows 7 is no longer supported. It may still work for you, but please note that we will not be able to provide support in case you encounter any issues when running Overwolf on this operating system.350MB on your hard driveIn-game support: DirectX 8, DirectX 9, DirectX 11, DirectX12 and OpenGLMicrosoft .Net 4.8CPU:Minimum: Intel or AMD quad-core CPU Recommend: Intel i3/i5/i7 Gen7 CPU or AMD Ryzen 1Gen with 3 GHz or higher frequencyRAM: Minimum: 8GBRecommend: 16GBOur goal is for Overwolf to run efficiently on your CPU and Video card. If your PC runs a game perfectly, it should easily support Overwolf.Note: Overwolf was not tested on VMs (Virtual Machines) and as such we cannot guarantee that Overwolf and Overwolf apps will work correctly when installed on a VM.Do you support macOS? ▾No, we only support Windows.Does Overwolf support dual screen setups? ▾Overwolf does not support dual screen setups. Overwolf can only be placed upon the main monitor and the last game you launch. We are considering support for dual monitors for the future.Why doesn't Overwolf work with any game streaming services?If you're streaming games via services like GeForce Now, Stadia, etc. - Overwolf's overlay will not work for you. This is because Overwolf must have a locally-running game process in order to be able to overlay on top of it.My Nvidia overlay starts recording a video when I launch Overwolf! ▾﻿We are aware of this issue and have found that it happens when the recording hotkey setting is empty.We have notified Nvidia about this, and until a permanent fix is deployed, the workaround solution is to simply assign a hotkey so the setting does not remain empty. This can be done by following these steps:Open GeForce ExperienceClick the 'Settings' button:Click the 'Settings' button under 'In-Game Overlay' or press Alt+Z:Click 'Keyboard shortcuts':Scroll down untill you reach the 'Record' section and the 'Toggle manual recording on/off and save' option in it:If the field is empty, simply click on it and assign any hotkey of your choice (the default is Shift+F9):Click 'Done' and that's it!\n\t",

    "title": "Common Capture Issues: Overwolf Support",
    "body": "When capturing videos with Overwolf you may encounter certain issues. We've collected several common ones, and added explanations and solutions so you could solve these issues on your own :)Game Highlights and Apps are Currently DownOccasionally you may come across a Tweet or an in-app status message that indicate that highlights and apps are currently down. In this case, your highlights will not be captured automatically, however you can still capture manual videos of the game.You don't need to do anything; this situation will be resolved on it's own. We only ask for your patience until we finish patching things up and bring the highlights and apps back to work!For more information, please visit the following article: Apps and Highlights Status Explanation.Take me to...Stuttering/Lagging/Freezing VideosGPU DriversCodecsPresetsHigh Quality SettingsHardware-accelerated GPU schedulingWindows Game OptionsAMD Ryzen ProcessorSoftware/App CoexistenceSound IssuesSound DriversSound not recorded at allOnly recording input sound, output sounds (game, music, etc.) are missingNot recording friends' voices from DiscordUnsupported Sound Format IssueMicrophone sound only heard from left/rightNVIDIA Broadcast issuesVideos Not Captured At AllGPU DriversSHT Compatibility ModeSwitchable DevicesRecording Minimum Requirements ▾Ransomware Protection Blocking RecordingDPI / Offset IssuesRecordings appearing brighter than in-gameStuttering/Lagging/Freezing VideosGPU DriversIf you're experiencing stuttering (frame loss) in your captured videos, unsynced audio and video, videos freezing on one frame, or no video capturing at all your graphics card's drivers may be out of date.Outdated drivers may prevent your graphics card's encoder from working properly (the encoders are essential for the capturing process), and as a result you might experience different issues with the capturing process.Please make sure that your drivers are up to date by visiting your graphics card's developer's website:AMDNvidia IntelOnce you update your drivers it's important to restart your PC (in order for the changes to be applied) before you try to capture videos again.CodecsThe best capturing results can usually be achieved by selecting a codec that uses your dedicated GPU for the encoding process. Other codecs, mainly the x264, use your CPU.Choosing a CPU based codec often result in faulty videos because the CPU has a hard time running the capturing process in addition to all the other system tasks.The codec can be changed through the recording app settings or Overwolf's Capture settings:If your graphics card's encoder is unavailable (grayed out) despite having the latest drivers, you can take a deeper-effective measure and try a clean driver install.For more information on encoders, please visit the articles in the following category: Codecs.PresetsCertain presets may use more of your systems resources, and result in faulty video recordings. Please make sure to have your preset option set to either \"Default\" or \"Automatic\" and try to record again.High Quality SettingsIf your capturing quality settings (resolution, FPS) are set higher than what your system can handle, it will result in faulty videos. You should try to lower the capturing resolution and FPS before launching the game, and then check if the results have improved.Hardware-accelerated GPU schedulingWindows 10's new version, 2004 (build 19041), includes a new graphics setting: Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling. When turned on, this setting may interfere with Overwolf's OBS-based capture engine and cause various issues with the capturing process and the resulted videos. Turning this setting off can help overcome these issues.Windows 11:If you prefer to keep the Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling enabled, you can try to switch the game's display mode from 'Fullscreen' to 'Windowed'/'Windowed Borderless' in order to eliminate lags/dropped frames.Windows Game OptionsDisabling the following options, through the system settings, can improve the recording:Xbox Game BarBackground recordingGame Mode AMD Ryzen ProcessorIf you have an AMD Ryzen processor, you should try updating your system's BIOS, as we've seen it can solve the issue. You will need to enter your motherboard's manufacturer's website and follow the steps according to your specific motherboard model.Software/App CoexistenceIf you have any other video capturing/streaming software (like Nvidia ShadowPlay/NVIDIA Share/OBS Studio, for instance), streaming process or live wallpaper engine (Such as Lively Wallpaper/Wallpaper Engine) running at the same time as your Overwolf capturing app, this may affect the resulting video, or even prevent Overwolf's app from capturing your gameplay entirely.Please disable or close the relevant software and try to capture your gameplay again with your Overwolf app.Lastly, please make sure that you are not using the recording features of multiple Overwolf apps at the same time as this may cause issues in the recordings. Examples of Overwolf apps with recording features:AvatarBUFFGame CaptureGazoomInsights CaptureMedalNuked.TVOutplayedValorant Tracker (TRN)Replay HUDReplays.lolNvidia G-SYNCPlease note that running Nvidia G-SYNC may also cause issues with recording. You can disable it using the following steps:Right-click on your desktop and click on “Nvidia Control Panel” from the menuClick on the “+” next to DisplaySelect Set up G-SYNCUncheck the box next to Enable G-SYNCSound IssuesSound DriversDifferent sound issues can be the result of outdated sound drivers, so the first thing to make sure of is that you have the most recent drivers installed.You can find Realtek drivers right here, and the drivers for any other audio devices in the manufacturer's website.Sound not recorded at allIf you can't hear any sound at all in your captured videos, you may have one of the following software running and conflicting with Overwolf: Nahimic, Alienware Sound Center or Asus Sonic Radar. Please close them when recording with Overwolf to avoid any issues.Only recording input sound, output sounds (game, music, etc.) are missingIf you have recently updated your Windows OS, and have since been having trouble capturing your system's output sounds, you should try the solution presented here: How “Windows Sonic” Spatial Sound Works.This issue can also be caused due to incompatibility between certain headset models and Overwolf's capture engine.Not recording friends' voices from DiscordIf you have a SteelSeries Arctis or HyperX headset with chat/game sound balance, and you can't hear your friends' voices on Discord in your captured videos (only your own voice and other sounds from your system) you can fix this issue by changing settings in Discord.The SteelSeries Arctis and HyperX headsets are using two different channels to output sound, while Overwolf's capture engine can only record one channel at a time.In order for your friends' voices to be recorded too, you will need to open up Discord's settings window, go to \"Voice & Video\", and change the \"Output Device\" to \"Arctis 7 Game\" or \"HyperX [Model Name] Game\":Unsupported Sound Format IssueWhen trying to use any of Overwolf's video recording apps with a specific sound format, you may encounter an error that says \"Unsupported sound format issue\". This issue may occur when using some kind of USB headset/microphone or a webcam microphone, and to solve it you should change the Default Format setting of your playback/recording device to \"Tape Recorder\".Microphone sound only heard from left/rightIf the sound recorded from your microphone can only be heard from one side (left or right), please check your microphone's channel setting:Right-click the speaker icon in your task barSelect 'Recording devices'Right-click your microphone from the list of devicesSelect 'Properties'Go to 'Advanced'Under 'Default Format' make sure the option '1 channel, 16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality)' is selectedClick 'Apply' and 'OK', and try to record your gameplay againNVIDIA Broadcast issuesPlease note that using NVIDIA Broadcast may cause audio issues when recording.Additionally, enabling the NVIDIA Broadcast Noise Removal feature will remove all game noise effects.Videos Not Captured At AllGPU DriversIf your gameplay videos are not being captured at all, you should first check whether your graphics card's drivers are up to date.Outdated drivers may prevent your graphics card's encoder from working properly (the encoders are essential for the capturing process), and as a result you might experience different issues with the capturing process.Please make sure that your drivers are up to date by visiting your graphics card's developer's website:AMDNvidia IntelOnce you update your drivers it's important to restart your PC (in order for the changes to be applied) before you try to capture videos again.SHT Compatibility ModeIf your videos only show black frames, and you have both an integrated GPU and a dedicated GPU, please enable the 'Shared texture compatibility mode' option in Overwolf's capture settings:Switchable DevicesHaving switchable devices in your systems means that different programs can run on different graphics cards (usually the integrated one or the dedicated one).When Overwolf's capture engine is running on one graphics card, and the game is running on the other - it can result in a black screen capture, or no videos being captured at all.The solution is to set Overwolf's capture engine to run on your dedicated graphics card, the same one that the game is running on. This is how you can do that:Legacy:NvidiaRecording Minimum Requirements ▾The following are the minimum requirements for recording with Overwolf apps (having a setup with lower specs may cause issues):Intel CPU: Intel i3 processors that support the Intel Quick Sync encoder. For the supported processors list, click here.AMD CPU: AMD Ryzen processors that support the AMF encoder (integrated Vega graphics unit).*OR*GPU: Versions of Nvidia graphics cards that support the NVENC encoder (GT/M versions might not work).Users with AMD graphics cards can try the AMF encoder, check the supported cards here.RAM: 8GB or more of RAM (16GB recommended!)For more information, please visit the following article: Overwolf Recording Minimum Requirements.Ransomware Protection Blocking RecordingWhen the Windows Ransomware Protection is enabled it may block Overwolf apps from recording. You can test if Windows Ransomware Protection is blocking Overwolf by temporarily disabling it under the Windows Security settings:If disabling the Windows Ransomware Protection resolves the issue you can click on \"Protected folder\" and set your media folder as an exception or set the media folder to an unprotected folder. If you are using Outplayed you can change the media folder using this guide: How to change the Outplayed Media folder DPI / Offset IssuesDoes the app's overlay look too big in-game? Is your cursor mislocated from where you actually click?These issues could be the result of having your DPI set higher than 100%, and the solution is setting it back to that scale in the display settings of Windows. To find out how you can change your DPI setting, please visit the following article: How to Scale down your DPI.Another option that cause an offset is the system's text size. To change it, please open the system settings > 'Ease of Access' > 'Display', and lower the text size to minimum.Recordings appearing brighter than in-gameIf your recordings are appearing brighter than the game please verify that any HDR setting has been disabled and restart the computer.If you are running an AMD graphic card please verify that the \"10-Bit Pixel Format\" setting is disabled and that the computer has been restarted: \n\t",

If there is an additional .NET Framework version in the list, as seen in the screenshot below, make sure that it is ticked as well:5. Restart your system (if asked to) and try to launch the Overwolf installer again.If the .NET Framework 3.5 feature is already enabled, you may going to need reinstall the higher .NET Framework version (4.8) installed on your system. For more information, please visit this article.Overwolf setup installer ▾If the above-mentioned solutions did not help you overcome the issue, please try to run the setup installer.It comes in a zipped file, so you will first need to extract it by using any program like WinZip, WinRAR or 7-Zip.Once the installation is complete you can go ahead and start downloading awesome apps for your games!Clean reinstall Overwolf client ▾If all of the above does not work, and you are still unable to install Overwolf, then try doing a full clean sweep of all Overwolf files, then try to re-install it. To uninstall Overwolf just go to: Start -> Control Panel -> Uninstall a Program and uninstall Overwolf.Once you finish uninstalling, head to C:\\Program Files (x86) and check if you have an Overwolf folder (you shouldn't). Delete it, and proceed to do the following:Press the Windows key + RType: %localappdata%Press enterLook for a folder named 'Overwolf'Delete itOnce you finish, please re-download (choose your favorite app) and launch Overwolf.Installation file is getting removed ▾If the installation file is finished downloading but it's missing from your 'Downloads' folder, it usually means an antivirus or a download manager software are automatically deleting it. When clicking the file to run it, you may notice that the browser's download bar or page says the file is either 'Removed' or 'Failed - Download error'. For example:We've seen this happen to users who have SAntivirus/Segurazo installed (sometimes, without even their knowledge), but it might also happen with other software. To resolve the issue you can temporarily disable the antivirus software and redownload the installer. For more information, please visit this article.RivaTuner conflict ▾RivaTuner Statistics Server is a hardware monitoring program that usually comes bundled with MSI Afterburner. Sometimes, it may conflict with Overwolf and prevent it from running properly (or running at all). To prevent any such issues, please follow the suggestions in our Overwolf and Conflicts with RivaTuner article, or close RivaTuner entirely for the duration of the installation (you may need to close MSI Afterburner first).Issue not resolved?

If your PC runs a game perfectly, it should easily support Overwolf.Note: Overwolf was not tested on VMs (Virtual Machines) and as such we cannot guarantee that Overwolf and Overwolf apps will work correctly when installed on a VM.Do you support macOS? ▾No, we only support Windows.Does Overwolf support dual screen setups? ▾Overwolf does not support dual screen setups. Overwolf can only be placed upon the main monitor and the last game you launch. We are considering support for dual monitors for the future.Why doesn't Overwolf work with any game streaming services?If you're streaming games via services like GeForce Now, Stadia, etc. - Overwolf's overlay will not work for you. This is because Overwolf must have a locally-running game process in order to be able to overlay on top of it.My Nvidia overlay starts recording a video when I launch Overwolf! ▾﻿We are aware of this issue and have found that it happens when the recording hotkey setting is empty.We have notified Nvidia about this, and until a permanent fix is deployed, the workaround solution is to simply assign a hotkey so the setting does not remain empty. This can be done by following these steps:Open GeForce ExperienceClick the 'Settings' button:Click the 'Settings' button under 'In-Game Overlay' or press Alt+Z:Click 'Keyboard shortcuts':Scroll down untill you reach the 'Record' section and the 'Toggle manual recording on/off and save' option in it:If the field is empty, simply click on it and assign any hotkey of your choice (the default is Shift+F9):Click 'Done' and that's it!\n\t",

    "body": "If you're experiencing any performance issues with your game, that are related to the system's FPS, CPU or memory, and you suspect it might be related to Overwolf, please have a look at the following list of causes and solutions:Take me to...Outdated DriversVideo CapturingRivaTuner Statistics ServerMouse Polling/Report RateMinimum RequirementsOutdated DriversFirst and foremost, it's important to make sure that your drivers are up to date. This includes your:Graphics card's driversSound driversWindows OSIf you install any drivers updates, you should restart your PC in order for the changes to be applied.Video CapturingIf you're using any Overwolf apps that capture videos of your gameplay, it's possible that the capturing process is causing performance issues.The process of capturing videos of your gameplay uses different system resources; RAM, CPU and GPU. These same resources are also responsible for running your game. This is why some effect on the game's FPS can be expected, but it's usually very minor and unnoticeable.In case you're experiencing a significant effect on your game's performance, it's best to make sure that:Your system meets the minimum capturing requirementsYour graphics card's drivers are up to dateYou have the correct codec set in Overwolf's capture settingsYour encoding preset is set to \"Default\" or \"Automatic\"Your FPS and resolution capturing settings are not set too high (according to your system's specs)You don't have any other video capturing/streaming programs running at the same time, like OBS or Nvidia ShadowPlayRivaTuner Statistics ServerRivaTuner Statistics Server is a software that usually comes bundled with the MSI Afterburner. It can conflict with Overwolf when both are running at the same time, and result in significant performance issues, game crashes and Overwolf crashes as well.No worries, though - you can follow the suggested solutions in our \"Overwolf and Conflicts with RivaTuner\" article, to resolve the conflict and have both Overwolf and RivaTuner running at the same time without any interruptions.Mouse Polling/Report RatePolling Rate (or Report Rate) is the at which data is transferring from the mouse to the system, and can be usually set up through the device's software (like Logitech G HUB, CORSAIR iCUE, Razer Synapse, etc.).We've found that in some cases, high polling/report rates (starting from 500Hz and higher) may cause performance issues (dropping FPS, mostly) that can seem to be related to overlays in general or to Overwolf's overlay specifically.We have found that in some cases the issue is resolved by installing the latest chipset drivers, according to your motherboard.Minimum RequirementsWe try to keep it simple, but there are some minimum requirements in order to run Overwolf properly:Operating System: Minimum: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)*Windows 7 is no longer supported. It may still work for you, but please note that we will not be able to provide support in case you encounter any issues when running Overwolf on this operating system.  350MB on your hard driveIn-game support: DirectX 8, DirectX 9, DirectX 11, DirectX12 and OpenGLMicrosoft .NET Framework 4.8CPU:Minimum: Intel or AMD quad-core CPU Recommend: Intel i3/i5/i7 Gen7 CPU or AMD Ryzen 1Gen with 3 GHz or higher frequencyRAM: Minimum: 8GBRecommend: 16GBIf your system specs are below these requirements, it is most likely that it's not strong enough to handle Overwolf, and running it may result in performance issues.Still having trouble?

What do you want to know?What is an Overlay, and How do I Make it Work?Creating an Overwolf AccountOverwolf's AppstoreVideo CapturingWhat is an Overlay, and How do I Make it Work?An overlay is essentially a \"layer\", that can be used to display windows and other elements on top of a game, and can be turned on and off according to your wants and needs, without affecting the game itself. You can read more about it right here.In order to have Overwolf's overlay ready for use with the game that you're playing, please open up Overwolf's settings window, and make sure that:The game appears on the listThe game's overlay option is enabledIs everything set correctly but you're still having trouble getting the overlay to work? Please check out our Overlay Troubleshooting guide.RegistrationWe recommend logging into Overwolf to be able to review apps and to subscribe to them. You can log in with your Google, Facebook or Discord account, or by creating a new Overwolf account:*Please note that some Overwolf apps may also ask you to register to their own service in order to start using them.AppstoreOverwolf's Appstore is where you'll find all the apps that Overwolf has to offer. You can open up the Appstore by right clicking on Overwolf's taskbar icon and choosing \"Appstore\" from the menu, or by clicking on the icon to bring up the dock, and clicking the box icon there.Within the Appstore, you can browse apps by a category, like Capture & Stream, or by a specific game. Once you find an app that you would like to try, simply click on the \"Install\" button, and it will be added to your Overwolf!You can now also subscribe to apps and support the app authors!

    "title": "Common Capture Issues: Overwolf Support",
    "body": "When capturing videos with Overwolf you may encounter certain issues. We've collected several common ones, and added explanations and solutions so you could solve these issues on your own :)Game Highlights and Apps are Currently DownOccasionally you may come across a Tweet or an in-app status message that indicate that highlights and apps are currently down. In this case, your highlights will not be captured automatically, however you can still capture manual videos of the game.You don't need to do anything; this situation will be resolved on it's own. We only ask for your patience until we finish patching things up and bring the highlights and apps back to work!For more information, please visit the following article: Apps and Highlights Status Explanation.Take me to...Stuttering/Lagging/Freezing VideosGPU DriversCodecsPresetsHigh Quality SettingsHardware-accelerated GPU schedulingWindows Game OptionsAMD Ryzen ProcessorSoftware/App CoexistenceSound IssuesSound DriversSound not recorded at allOnly recording input sound, output sounds (game, music, etc.) are missingNot recording friends' voices from DiscordUnsupported Sound Format IssueMicrophone sound only heard from left/rightNVIDIA Broadcast issuesVideos Not Captured At AllGPU DriversSHT Compatibility ModeSwitchable DevicesRecording Minimum Requirements ▾Ransomware Protection Blocking RecordingDPI / Offset IssuesRecordings appearing brighter than in-gameStuttering/Lagging/Freezing VideosGPU DriversIf you're experiencing stuttering (frame loss) in your captured videos, unsynced audio and video, videos freezing on one frame, or no video capturing at all your graphics card's drivers may be out of date.Outdated drivers may prevent your graphics card's encoder from working properly (the encoders are essential for the capturing process), and as a result you might experience different issues with the capturing process.Please make sure that your drivers are up to date by visiting your graphics card's developer's website:AMDNvidia IntelOnce you update your drivers it's important to restart your PC (in order for the changes to be applied) before you try to capture videos again.CodecsThe best capturing results can usually be achieved by selecting a codec that uses your dedicated GPU for the encoding process. Other codecs, mainly the x264, use your CPU.Choosing a CPU based codec often result in faulty videos because the CPU has a hard time running the capturing process in addition to all the other system tasks.The codec can be changed through the recording app settings or Overwolf's Capture settings:If your graphics card's encoder is unavailable (grayed out) despite having the latest drivers, you can take a deeper-effective measure and try a clean driver install.For more information on encoders, please visit the articles in the following category: Codecs.PresetsCertain presets may use more of your systems resources, and result in faulty video recordings. Please make sure to have your preset option set to either \"Default\" or \"Automatic\" and try to record again.High Quality SettingsIf your capturing quality settings (resolution, FPS) are set higher than what your system can handle, it will result in faulty videos. You should try to lower the capturing resolution and FPS before launching the game, and then check if the results have improved.Hardware-accelerated GPU schedulingWindows 10's new version, 2004 (build 19041), includes a new graphics setting: Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling. When turned on, this setting may interfere with Overwolf's OBS-based capture engine and cause various issues with the capturing process and the resulted videos. Turning this setting off can help overcome these issues.Windows 11:If you prefer to keep the Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling enabled, you can try to switch the game's display mode from 'Fullscreen' to 'Windowed'/'Windowed Borderless' in order to eliminate lags/dropped frames.Windows Game OptionsDisabling the following options, through the system settings, can improve the recording:Xbox Game BarBackground recordingGame Mode AMD Ryzen ProcessorIf you have an AMD Ryzen processor, you should try updating your system's BIOS, as we've seen it can solve the issue. You will need to enter your motherboard's manufacturer's website and follow the steps according to your specific motherboard model.Software/App CoexistenceIf you have any other video capturing/streaming software (like Nvidia ShadowPlay/NVIDIA Share/OBS Studio, for instance), streaming process or live wallpaper engine (Such as Lively Wallpaper/Wallpaper Engine) running at the same time as your Overwolf capturing app, this may affect the resulting video, or even prevent Overwolf's app from capturing your gameplay entirely.Please disable or close the relevant software and try to capture your gameplay again with your Overwolf app.Lastly, please make sure that you are not using the recording features of multiple Overwolf apps at the same time as this may cause issues in the recordings. Examples of Overwolf apps with recording features:AvatarBUFFGame CaptureGazoomInsights CaptureMedalNuked.TVOutplayedValorant Tracker (TRN)Replay HUDReplays.lolNvidia G-SYNCPlease note that running Nvidia G-SYNC may also cause issues with recording. You can disable it using the following steps:Right-click on your desktop and click on “Nvidia Control Panel” from the menuClick on the “+” next to DisplaySelect Set up G-SYNCUncheck the box next to Enable G-SYNCSound IssuesSound DriversDifferent sound issues can be the result of outdated sound drivers, so the first thing to make sure of is that you have the most recent drivers installed.You can find Realtek drivers right here, and the drivers for any other audio devices in the manufacturer's website.Sound not recorded at allIf you can't hear any sound at all in your captured videos, you may have one of the following software running and conflicting with Overwolf: Nahimic, Alienware Sound Center or Asus Sonic Radar. Please close them when recording with Overwolf to avoid any issues.Only recording input sound, output sounds (game, music, etc.) are missingIf you have recently updated your Windows OS, and have since been having trouble capturing your system's output sounds, you should try the solution presented here: How “Windows Sonic” Spatial Sound Works.This issue can also be caused due to incompatibility between certain headset models and Overwolf's capture engine.Not recording friends' voices from DiscordIf you have a SteelSeries Arctis or HyperX headset with chat/game sound balance, and you can't hear your friends' voices on Discord in your captured videos (only your own voice and other sounds from your system) you can fix this issue by changing settings in Discord.The SteelSeries Arctis and HyperX headsets are using two different channels to output sound, while Overwolf's capture engine can only record one channel at a time.In order for your friends' voices to be recorded too, you will need to open up Discord's settings window, go to \"Voice & Video\", and change the \"Output Device\" to \"Arctis 7 Game\" or \"HyperX [Model Name] Game\":Unsupported Sound Format IssueWhen trying to use any of Overwolf's video recording apps with a specific sound format, you may encounter an error that says \"Unsupported sound format issue\". This issue may occur when using some kind of USB headset/microphone or a webcam microphone, and to solve it you should change the Default Format setting of your playback/recording device to \"Tape Recorder\".Microphone sound only heard from left/rightIf the sound recorded from your microphone can only be heard from one side (left or right), please check your microphone's channel setting:Right-click the speaker icon in your task barSelect 'Recording devices'Right-click your microphone from the list of devicesSelect 'Properties'Go to 'Advanced'Under 'Default Format' make sure the option '1 channel, 16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality)' is selectedClick 'Apply' and 'OK', and try to record your gameplay againNVIDIA Broadcast issuesPlease note that using NVIDIA Broadcast may cause audio issues when recording.Additionally, enabling the NVIDIA Broadcast Noise Removal feature will remove all game noise effects.Videos Not Captured At AllGPU DriversIf your gameplay videos are not being captured at all, you should first check whether your graphics card's drivers are up to date.Outdated drivers may prevent your graphics card's encoder from working properly (the encoders are essential for the capturing process), and as a result you might experience different issues with the capturing process.Please make sure that your drivers are up to date by visiting your graphics card's developer's website:AMDNvidia IntelOnce you update your drivers it's important to restart your PC (in order for the changes to be applied) before you try to capture videos again.SHT Compatibility ModeIf your videos only show black frames, and you have both an integrated GPU and a dedicated GPU, please enable the 'Shared texture compatibility mode' option in Overwolf's capture settings:Switchable DevicesHaving switchable devices in your systems means that different programs can run on different graphics cards (usually the integrated one or the dedicated one).When Overwolf's capture engine is running on one graphics card, and the game is running on the other - it can result in a black screen capture, or no videos being captured at all.The solution is to set Overwolf's capture engine to run on your dedicated graphics card, the same one that the game is running on. This is how you can do that:Legacy:NvidiaRecording Minimum Requirements ▾The following are the minimum requirements for recording with Overwolf apps (having a setup with lower specs may cause issues):Intel CPU: Intel i3 processors that support the Intel Quick Sync encoder. For the supported processors list, click here.AMD CPU: AMD Ryzen processors that support the AMF encoder (integrated Vega graphics unit).*OR*GPU: Versions of Nvidia graphics cards that support the NVENC encoder (GT/M versions might not work).Users with AMD graphics cards can try the AMF encoder, check the supported cards here.RAM: 8GB or more of RAM (16GB recommended!)For more information, please visit the following article: Overwolf Recording Minimum Requirements.Ransomware Protection Blocking RecordingWhen the Windows Ransomware Protection is enabled it may block Overwolf apps from recording. You can test if Windows Ransomware Protection is blocking Overwolf by temporarily disabling it under the Windows Security settings:If disabling the Windows Ransomware Protection resolves the issue you can click on \"Protected folder\" and set your media folder as an exception or set the media folder to an unprotected folder. If you are using Outplayed you can change the media folder using this guide: How to change the Outplayed Media folder DPI / Offset IssuesDoes the app's overlay look too big in-game? Is your cursor mislocated from where you actually click?These issues could be the result of having your DPI set higher than 100%, and the solution is setting it back to that scale in the display settings of Windows. To find out how you can change your DPI setting, please visit the following article: How to Scale down your DPI.Another option that cause an offset is the system's text size. To change it, please open the system settings > 'Ease of Access' > 'Display', and lower the text size to minimum.Recordings appearing brighter than in-gameIf your recordings are appearing brighter than the game please verify that any HDR setting has been disabled and restart the computer.If you are running an AMD graphic card please verify that the \"10-Bit Pixel Format\" setting is disabled and that the computer has been restarted: \n\t",

If there is an additional .NET Framework version in the list, as seen in the screenshot below, make sure that it is ticked as well:5. Restart your system (if asked to) and try to launch the Overwolf installer again.If the .NET Framework 3.5 feature is already enabled, you may going to need reinstall the higher .NET Framework version (4.8) installed on your system. For more information, please visit this article.Overwolf setup installer ▾If the above-mentioned solutions did not help you overcome the issue, please try to run the setup installer.It comes in a zipped file, so you will first need to extract it by using any program like WinZip, WinRAR or 7-Zip.Once the installation is complete you can go ahead and start downloading awesome apps for your games!Clean reinstall Overwolf client ▾If all of the above does not work, and you are still unable to install Overwolf, then try doing a full clean sweep of all Overwolf files, then try to re-install it. To uninstall Overwolf just go to: Start -> Control Panel -> Uninstall a Program and uninstall Overwolf.Once you finish uninstalling, head to C:\\Program Files (x86) and check if you have an Overwolf folder (you shouldn't). Delete it, and proceed to do the following:Press the Windows key + RType: %localappdata%Press enterLook for a folder named 'Overwolf'Delete itOnce you finish, please re-download (choose your favorite app) and launch Overwolf.Installation file is getting removed ▾If the installation file is finished downloading but it's missing from your 'Downloads' folder, it usually means an antivirus or a download manager software are automatically deleting it. When clicking the file to run it, you may notice that the browser's download bar or page says the file is either 'Removed' or 'Failed - Download error'. For example:We've seen this happen to users who have SAntivirus/Segurazo installed (sometimes, without even their knowledge), but it might also happen with other software. To resolve the issue you can temporarily disable the antivirus software and redownload the installer. For more information, please visit this article.RivaTuner conflict ▾RivaTuner Statistics Server is a hardware monitoring program that usually comes bundled with MSI Afterburner. Sometimes, it may conflict with Overwolf and prevent it from running properly (or running at all). To prevent any such issues, please follow the suggestions in our Overwolf and Conflicts with RivaTuner article, or close RivaTuner entirely for the duration of the installation (you may need to close MSI Afterburner first).Issue not resolved?

    "body": "If you're experiencing any performance issues with your game, that are related to the system's FPS, CPU or memory, and you suspect it might be related to Overwolf, please have a look at the following list of causes and solutions:Take me to...Outdated DriversVideo CapturingRivaTuner Statistics ServerMouse Polling/Report RateMinimum RequirementsOutdated DriversFirst and foremost, it's important to make sure that your drivers are up to date. This includes your:Graphics card's driversSound driversWindows OSIf you install any drivers updates, you should restart your PC in order for the changes to be applied.Video CapturingIf you're using any Overwolf apps that capture videos of your gameplay, it's possible that the capturing process is causing performance issues.The process of capturing videos of your gameplay uses different system resources; RAM, CPU and GPU. These same resources are also responsible for running your game. This is why some effect on the game's FPS can be expected, but it's usually very minor and unnoticeable.In case you're experiencing a significant effect on your game's performance, it's best to make sure that:Your system meets the minimum capturing requirementsYour graphics card's drivers are up to dateYou have the correct codec set in Overwolf's capture settingsYour encoding preset is set to \"Default\" or \"Automatic\"Your FPS and resolution capturing settings are not set too high (according to your system's specs)You don't have any other video capturing/streaming programs running at the same time, like OBS or Nvidia ShadowPlayRivaTuner Statistics ServerRivaTuner Statistics Server is a software that usually comes bundled with the MSI Afterburner. It can conflict with Overwolf when both are running at the same time, and result in significant performance issues, game crashes and Overwolf crashes as well.No worries, though - you can follow the suggested solutions in our \"Overwolf and Conflicts with RivaTuner\" article, to resolve the conflict and have both Overwolf and RivaTuner running at the same time without any interruptions.Mouse Polling/Report RatePolling Rate (or Report Rate) is the at which data is transferring from the mouse to the system, and can be usually set up through the device's software (like Logitech G HUB, CORSAIR iCUE, Razer Synapse, etc.).We've found that in some cases, high polling/report rates (starting from 500Hz and higher) may cause performance issues (dropping FPS, mostly) that can seem to be related to overlays in general or to Overwolf's overlay specifically.We have found that in some cases the issue is resolved by installing the latest chipset drivers, according to your motherboard.Minimum RequirementsWe try to keep it simple, but there are some minimum requirements in order to run Overwolf properly:Operating System: Minimum: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)*Windows 7 is no longer supported. It may still work for you, but please note that we will not be able to provide support in case you encounter any issues when running Overwolf on this operating system.  350MB on your hard driveIn-game support: DirectX 8, DirectX 9, DirectX 11, DirectX12 and OpenGLMicrosoft .NET Framework 4.8CPU:Minimum: Intel or AMD quad-core CPU Recommend: Intel i3/i5/i7 Gen7 CPU or AMD Ryzen 1Gen with 3 GHz or higher frequencyRAM: Minimum: 8GBRecommend: 16GBIf your system specs are below these requirements, it is most likely that it's not strong enough to handle Overwolf, and running it may result in performance issues.Still having trouble? Please contact us and we will do our best to help!\n\t",

What do you want to know?What is an Overlay, and How do I Make it Work?Creating an Overwolf AccountOverwolf's AppstoreVideo CapturingWhat is an Overlay, and How do I Make it Work?An overlay is essentially a \"layer\", that can be used to display windows and other elements on top of a game, and can be turned on and off according to your wants and needs, without affecting the game itself. You can read more about it right here.In order to have Overwolf's overlay ready for use with the game that you're playing, please open up Overwolf's settings window, and make sure that:The game appears on the listThe game's overlay option is enabledIs everything set correctly but you're still having trouble getting the overlay to work? Please check out our Overlay Troubleshooting guide.RegistrationWe recommend logging into Overwolf to be able to review apps and to subscribe to them. You can log in with your Google, Facebook or Discord account, or by creating a new Overwolf account:*Please note that some Overwolf apps may also ask you to register to their own service in order to start using them.AppstoreOverwolf's Appstore is where you'll find all the apps that Overwolf has to offer. You can open up the Appstore by right clicking on Overwolf's taskbar icon and choosing \"Appstore\" from the menu, or by clicking on the icon to bring up the dock, and clicking the box icon there.Within the Appstore, you can browse apps by a category, like Capture & Stream, or by a specific game. Once you find an app that you would like to try, simply click on the \"Install\" button, and it will be added to your Overwolf!You can now also subscribe to apps and support the app authors! Read more about subscribing to apps Here.Capture SettingsTo start capturing videos of your gameplay, please download one of the capturing apps available in our appstore. Once an app with a game or screen capture feature is installed, you will be able to access Overwolf's Capture settings.The default capture settings are 720p and 30 FPS. If you would like to change the resolution, FPS or other capture settings, you can do so by opening Overwolf's settings window and clicking on the \"Capture\" tab:If you encounter any issue when recording your gameplay, please visit our Common Capture Issues article.\n\t",

    "title": "Common Capture Issues: Overwolf Support",
    "body": "When capturing videos with Overwolf you may encounter certain issues. We've collected several common ones, and added explanations and solutions so you could solve these issues on your own :)Game Highlights and Apps are Currently DownOccasionally you may come across a Tweet or an in-app status message that indicate that highlights and apps are currently down. In this case, your highlights will not be captured automatically, however you can still capture manual videos of the game.You don't need to do anything; this situation will be resolved on it's own. We only ask for your patience until we finish patching things up and bring the highlights and apps back to work!For more information, please visit the following article: Apps and Highlights Status Explanation.Take me to...Stuttering/Lagging/Freezing VideosGPU DriversCodecsPresetsHigh Quality SettingsHardware-accelerated GPU schedulingWindows Game OptionsAMD Ryzen ProcessorSoftware/App CoexistenceSound IssuesSound DriversSound not recorded at allOnly recording input sound, output sounds (game, music, etc.) are missingNot recording friends' voices from DiscordUnsupported Sound Format IssueMicrophone sound only heard from left/rightNVIDIA Broadcast issuesVideos Not Captured At AllGPU DriversSHT Compatibility ModeSwitchable DevicesRecording Minimum Requirements ▾Ransomware Protection Blocking RecordingDPI / Offset IssuesRecordings appearing brighter than in-gameStuttering/Lagging/Freezing VideosGPU DriversIf you're experiencing stuttering (frame loss) in your captured videos, unsynced audio and video, videos freezing on one frame, or no video capturing at all your graphics card's drivers may be out of date.Outdated drivers may prevent your graphics card's encoder from working properly (the encoders are essential for the capturing process), and as a result you might experience different issues with the capturing process.Please make sure that your drivers are up to date by visiting your graphics card's developer's website:AMDNvidia IntelOnce you update your drivers it's important to restart your PC (in order for the changes to be applied) before you try to capture videos again.CodecsThe best capturing results can usually be achieved by selecting a codec that uses your dedicated GPU for the encoding process. Other codecs, mainly the x264, use your CPU.Choosing a CPU based codec often result in faulty videos because the CPU has a hard time running the capturing process in addition to all the other system tasks.The codec can be changed through the recording app settings or Overwolf's Capture settings:If your graphics card's encoder is unavailable (grayed out) despite having the latest drivers, you can take a deeper-effective measure and try a clean driver install.For more information on encoders, please visit the articles in the following category: Codecs.PresetsCertain presets may use more of your systems resources, and result in faulty video recordings. Please make sure to have your preset option set to either \"Default\" or \"Automatic\" and try to record again.High Quality SettingsIf your capturing quality settings (resolution, FPS) are set higher than what your system can handle, it will result in faulty videos. You should try to lower the capturing resolution and FPS before launching the game, and then check if the results have improved.Hardware-accelerated GPU schedulingWindows 10's new version, 2004 (build 19041), includes a new graphics setting: Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling. When turned on, this setting may interfere with Overwolf's OBS-based capture engine and cause various issues with the capturing process and the resulted videos. Turning this setting off can help overcome these issues.Windows 11:If you prefer to keep the Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling enabled, you can try to switch the game's display mode from 'Fullscreen' to 'Windowed'/'Windowed Borderless' in order to eliminate lags/dropped frames.Windows Game OptionsDisabling the following options, through the system settings, can improve the recording:Xbox Game BarBackground recordingGame Mode AMD Ryzen ProcessorIf you have an AMD Ryzen processor, you should try updating your system's BIOS, as we've seen it can solve the issue. You will need to enter your motherboard's manufacturer's website and follow the steps according to your specific motherboard model.Software/App CoexistenceIf you have any other video capturing/streaming software (like Nvidia ShadowPlay/NVIDIA Share/OBS Studio, for instance), streaming process or live wallpaper engine (Such as Lively Wallpaper/Wallpaper Engine) running at the same time as your Overwolf capturing app, this may affect the resulting video, or even prevent Overwolf's app from capturing your gameplay entirely.Please disable or close the relevant software and try to capture your gameplay again with your Overwolf app.Lastly, please make sure that you are not using the recording features of multiple Overwolf apps at the same time as this may cause issues in the recordings. Examples of Overwolf apps with recording features:AvatarBUFFGame CaptureGazoomInsights CaptureMedalNuked.TVOutplayedValorant Tracker (TRN)Replay HUDReplays.lolNvidia G-SYNCPlease note that running Nvidia G-SYNC may also cause issues with recording. You can disable it using the following steps:Right-click on your desktop and click on “Nvidia Control Panel” from the menuClick on the “+” next to DisplaySelect Set up G-SYNCUncheck the box next to Enable G-SYNCSound IssuesSound DriversDifferent sound issues can be the result of outdated sound drivers, so the first thing to make sure of is that you have the most recent drivers installed.You can find Realtek drivers right here, and the drivers for any other audio devices in the manufacturer's website.Sound not recorded at allIf you can't hear any sound at all in your captured videos, you may have one of the following software running and conflicting with Overwolf: Nahimic, Alienware Sound Center or Asus Sonic Radar. Please close them when recording with Overwolf to avoid any issues.Only recording input sound, output sounds (game, music, etc.) are missingIf you have recently updated your Windows OS, and have since been having trouble capturing your system's output sounds, you should try the solution presented here: How “Windows Sonic” Spatial Sound Works.This issue can also be caused due to incompatibility between certain headset models and Overwolf's capture engine.Not recording friends' voices from DiscordIf you have a SteelSeries Arctis or HyperX headset with chat/game sound balance, and you can't hear your friends' voices on Discord in your captured videos (only your own voice and other sounds from your system) you can fix this issue by changing settings in Discord.The SteelSeries Arctis and HyperX headsets are using two different channels to output sound, while Overwolf's capture engine can only record one channel at a time.In order for your friends' voices to be recorded too, you will need to open up Discord's settings window, go to \"Voice & Video\", and change the \"Output Device\" to \"Arctis 7 Game\" or \"HyperX [Model Name] Game\":Unsupported Sound Format IssueWhen trying to use any of Overwolf's video recording apps with a specific sound format, you may encounter an error that says \"Unsupported sound format issue\". This issue may occur when using some kind of USB headset/microphone or a webcam microphone, and to solve it you should change the Default Format setting of your playback/recording device to \"Tape Recorder\".Microphone sound only heard from left/rightIf the sound recorded from your microphone can only be heard from one side (left or right), please check your microphone's channel setting:Right-click the speaker icon in your task barSelect 'Recording devices'Right-click your microphone from the list of devicesSelect 'Properties'Go to 'Advanced'Under 'Default Format' make sure the option '1 channel, 16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality)' is selectedClick 'Apply' and 'OK', and try to record your gameplay againNVIDIA Broadcast issuesPlease note that using NVIDIA Broadcast may cause audio issues when recording.Additionally, enabling the NVIDIA Broadcast Noise Removal feature will remove all game noise effects.Videos Not Captured At AllGPU DriversIf your gameplay videos are not being captured at all, you should first check whether your graphics card's drivers are up to date.Outdated drivers may prevent your graphics card's encoder from working properly (the encoders are essential for the capturing process), and as a result you might experience different issues with the capturing process.Please make sure that your drivers are up to date by visiting your graphics card's developer's website:AMDNvidia IntelOnce you update your drivers it's important to restart your PC (in order for the changes to be applied) before you try to capture videos again.SHT Compatibility ModeIf your videos only show black frames, and you have both an integrated GPU and a dedicated GPU, please enable the 'Shared texture compatibility mode' option in Overwolf's capture settings:Switchable DevicesHaving switchable devices in your systems means that different programs can run on different graphics cards (usually the integrated one or the dedicated one).When Overwolf's capture engine is running on one graphics card, and the game is running on the other - it can result in a black screen capture, or no videos being captured at all.The solution is to set Overwolf's capture engine to run on your dedicated graphics card, the same one that the game is running on. This is how you can do that:Legacy:NvidiaRecording Minimum Requirements ▾The following are the minimum requirements for recording with Overwolf apps (having a setup with lower specs may cause issues):Intel CPU: Intel i3 processors that support the Intel Quick Sync encoder. For the supported processors list, click here.AMD CPU: AMD Ryzen processors that support the AMF encoder (integrated Vega graphics unit).*OR*GPU: Versions of Nvidia graphics cards that support the NVENC encoder (GT/M versions might not work).Users with AMD graphics cards can try the AMF encoder, check the supported cards here.RAM: 8GB or more of RAM (16GB recommended!)For more information, please visit the following article: Overwolf Recording Minimum Requirements.Ransomware Protection Blocking RecordingWhen the Windows Ransomware Protection is enabled it may block Overwolf apps from recording. You can test if Windows Ransomware Protection is blocking Overwolf by temporarily disabling it under the Windows Security settings:If disabling the Windows Ransomware Protection resolves the issue you can click on \"Protected folder\" and set your media folder as an exception or set the media folder to an unprotected folder. If you are using Outplayed you can change the media folder using this guide: How to change the Outplayed Media folder DPI / Offset IssuesDoes the app's overlay look too big in-game? Is your cursor mislocated from where you actually click?These issues could be the result of having your DPI set higher than 100%, and the solution is setting it back to that scale in the display settings of Windows. To find out how you can change your DPI setting, please visit the following article: How to Scale down your DPI.Another option that cause an offset is the system's text size. To change it, please open the system settings > 'Ease of Access' > 'Display', and lower the text size to minimum.Recordings appearing brighter than in-gameIf your recordings are appearing brighter than the game please verify that any HDR setting has been disabled and restart the computer.If you are running an AMD graphic card please verify that the \"10-Bit Pixel Format\" setting is disabled and that the computer has been restarted: \n\t",

If there is an additional .NET Framework version in the list, as seen in the screenshot below, make sure that it is ticked as well:5. Restart your system (if asked to) and try to launch the Overwolf installer again.If the .NET Framework 3.5 feature is already enabled, you may going to need reinstall the higher .NET Framework version (4.8) installed on your system. For more information, please visit this article.Overwolf setup installer ▾If the above-mentioned solutions did not help you overcome the issue, please try to run the setup installer.It comes in a zipped file, so you will first need to extract it by using any program like WinZip, WinRAR or 7-Zip.Once the installation is complete you can go ahead and start downloading awesome apps for your games!Clean reinstall Overwolf client ▾If all of the above does not work, and you are still unable to install Overwolf, then try doing a full clean sweep of all Overwolf files, then try to re-install it. To uninstall Overwolf just go to: Start -> Control Panel -> Uninstall a Program and uninstall Overwolf.Once you finish uninstalling, head to C:\\Program Files (x86) and check if you have an Overwolf folder (you shouldn't). Delete it, and proceed to do the following:Press the Windows key + RType: %localappdata%Press enterLook for a folder named 'Overwolf'Delete itOnce you finish, please re-download (choose your favorite app) and launch Overwolf.Installation file is getting removed ▾If the installation file is finished downloading but it's missing from your 'Downloads' folder, it usually means an antivirus or a download manager software are automatically deleting it. When clicking the file to run it, you may notice that the browser's download bar or page says the file is either 'Removed' or 'Failed - Download error'. For example:We've seen this happen to users who have SAntivirus/Segurazo installed (sometimes, without even their knowledge), but it might also happen with other software. To resolve the issue you can temporarily disable the antivirus software and redownload the installer. For more information, please visit this article.RivaTuner conflict ▾RivaTuner Statistics Server is a hardware monitoring program that usually comes bundled with MSI Afterburner. Sometimes, it may conflict with Overwolf and prevent it from running properly (or running at all). To prevent any such issues, please follow the suggestions in our Overwolf and Conflicts with RivaTuner article, or close RivaTuner entirely for the duration of the installation (you may need to close MSI Afterburner first).Issue not resolved?

This is why some effect on the game's FPS can be expected, but it's usually very minor and unnoticeable.In case you're experiencing a significant effect on your game's performance, it's best to make sure that:Your system meets the minimum capturing requirementsYour graphics card's drivers are up to dateYou have the correct codec set in Overwolf's capture settingsYour encoding preset is set to \"Default\" or \"Automatic\"Your FPS and resolution capturing settings are not set too high (according to your system's specs)You don't have any other video capturing/streaming programs running at the same time, like OBS or Nvidia ShadowPlayRivaTuner Statistics ServerRivaTuner Statistics Server is a software that usually comes bundled with the MSI Afterburner. It can conflict with Overwolf when both are running at the same time, and result in significant performance issues, game crashes and Overwolf crashes as well.No worries, though - you can follow the suggested solutions in our \"Overwolf and Conflicts with RivaTuner\" article, to resolve the conflict and have both Overwolf and RivaTuner running at the same time without any interruptions.Mouse Polling/Report RatePolling Rate (or Report Rate) is the at which data is transferring from the mouse to the system, and can be usually set up through the device's software (like Logitech G HUB, CORSAIR iCUE, Razer Synapse, etc.).We've found that in some cases, high polling/report rates (starting from 500Hz and higher) may cause performance issues (dropping FPS, mostly) that can seem to be related to overlays in general or to Overwolf's overlay specifically.We have found that in some cases the issue is resolved by installing the latest chipset drivers, according to your motherboard.Minimum RequirementsWe try to keep it simple, but there are some minimum requirements in order to run Overwolf properly:Operating System: Minimum: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)*Windows 7 is no longer supported. It may still work for you, but please note that we will not be able to provide support in case you encounter any issues when running Overwolf on this operating system.  350MB on your hard driveIn-game support: DirectX 8, DirectX 9, DirectX 11, DirectX12 and OpenGLMicrosoft .NET Framework 4.8CPU:Minimum: Intel or AMD quad-core CPU Recommend: Intel i3/i5/i7 Gen7 CPU or AMD Ryzen 1Gen with 3 GHz or higher frequencyRAM: Minimum: 8GBRecommend: 16GBIf your system specs are below these requirements, it is most likely that it's not strong enough to handle Overwolf, and running it may result in performance issues.Still having trouble? Please contact us and we will do our best to help!\n\t",

You can read more about it right here.In order to have Overwolf's overlay ready for use with the game that you're playing, please open up Overwolf's settings window, and make sure that:The game appears on the listThe game's overlay option is enabledIs everything set correctly but you're still having trouble getting the overlay to work? Please check out our Overlay Troubleshooting guide.RegistrationWe recommend logging into Overwolf to be able to review apps and to subscribe to them. You can log in with your Google, Facebook or Discord account, or by creating a new Overwolf account:*Please note that some Overwolf apps may also ask you to register to their own service in order to start using them.AppstoreOverwolf's Appstore is where you'll find all the apps that Overwolf has to offer. You can open up the Appstore by right clicking on Overwolf's taskbar icon and choosing \"Appstore\" from the menu, or by clicking on the icon to bring up the dock, and clicking the box icon there.Within the Appstore, you can browse apps by a category, like Capture & Stream, or by a specific game.

    "title": "Common Capture Issues: Overwolf Support",
    "body": "When capturing videos with Overwolf you may encounter certain issues. We've collected several common ones, and added explanations and solutions so you could solve these issues on your own :)Game Highlights and Apps are Currently DownOccasionally you may come across a Tweet or an in-app status message that indicate that highlights and apps are currently down. In this case, your highlights will not be captured automatically, however you can still capture manual videos of the game.You don't need to do anything; this situation will be resolved on it's own. We only ask for your patience until we finish patching things up and bring the highlights and apps back to work!For more information, please visit the following article: Apps and Highlights Status Explanation.Take me to...Stuttering/Lagging/Freezing VideosGPU DriversCodecsPresetsHigh Quality SettingsHardware-accelerated GPU schedulingWindows Game OptionsAMD Ryzen ProcessorSoftware/App CoexistenceSound IssuesSound DriversSound not recorded at allOnly recording input sound, output sounds (game, music, etc.) are missingNot recording friends' voices from DiscordUnsupported Sound Format IssueMicrophone sound only heard from left/rightNVIDIA Broadcast issuesVideos Not Captured At AllGPU DriversSHT Compatibility ModeSwitchable DevicesRecording Minimum Requirements ▾Ransomware Protection Blocking RecordingDPI / Offset IssuesRecordings appearing brighter than in-gameStuttering/Lagging/Freezing VideosGPU DriversIf you're experiencing stuttering (frame loss) in your captured videos, unsynced audio and video, videos freezing on one frame, or no video capturing at all your graphics card's drivers may be out of date.Outdated drivers may prevent your graphics card's encoder from working properly (the encoders are essential for the capturing process), and as a result you might experience different issues with the capturing process.Please make sure that your drivers are up to date by visiting your graphics card's developer's website:AMDNvidia IntelOnce you update your drivers it's important to restart your PC (in order for the changes to be applied) before you try to capture videos again.CodecsThe best capturing results can usually be achieved by selecting a codec that uses your dedicated GPU for the encoding process. Other codecs, mainly the x264, use your CPU.Choosing a CPU based codec often result in faulty videos because the CPU has a hard time running the capturing process in addition to all the other system tasks.The codec can be changed through the recording app settings or Overwolf's Capture settings:If your graphics card's encoder is unavailable (grayed out) despite having the latest drivers, you can take a deeper-effective measure and try a clean driver install.For more information on encoders, please visit the articles in the following category: Codecs.PresetsCertain presets may use more of your systems resources, and result in faulty video recordings. Please make sure to have your preset option set to either \"Default\" or \"Automatic\" and try to record again.High Quality SettingsIf your capturing quality settings (resolution, FPS) are set higher than what your system can handle, it will result in faulty videos. You should try to lower the capturing resolution and FPS before launching the game, and then check if the results have improved.Hardware-accelerated GPU schedulingWindows 10's new version, 2004 (build 19041), includes a new graphics setting: Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling. When turned on, this setting may interfere with Overwolf's OBS-based capture engine and cause various issues with the capturing process and the resulted videos. Turning this setting off can help overcome these issues.Windows 11:If you prefer to keep the Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling enabled, you can try to switch the game's display mode from 'Fullscreen' to 'Windowed'/'Windowed Borderless' in order to eliminate lags/dropped frames.Windows Game OptionsDisabling the following options, through the system settings, can improve the recording:Xbox Game BarBackground recordingGame Mode AMD Ryzen ProcessorIf you have an AMD Ryzen processor, you should try updating your system's BIOS, as we've seen it can solve the issue. You will need to enter your motherboard's manufacturer's website and follow the steps according to your specific motherboard model.Software/App CoexistenceIf you have any other video capturing/streaming software (like Nvidia ShadowPlay/NVIDIA Share/OBS Studio, for instance), streaming process or live wallpaper engine (Such as Lively Wallpaper/Wallpaper Engine) running at the same time as your Overwolf capturing app, this may affect the resulting video, or even prevent Overwolf's app from capturing your gameplay entirely.Please disable or close the relevant software and try to capture your gameplay again with your Overwolf app.Lastly, please make sure that you are not using the recording features of multiple Overwolf apps at the same time as this may cause issues in the recordings. Examples of Overwolf apps with recording features:AvatarBUFFGame CaptureGazoomInsights CaptureMedalNuked.TVOutplayedValorant Tracker (TRN)Replay HUDReplays.lolNvidia G-SYNCPlease note that running Nvidia G-SYNC may also cause issues with recording. You can disable it using the following steps:Right-click on your desktop and click on “Nvidia Control Panel” from the menuClick on the “+” next to DisplaySelect Set up G-SYNCUncheck the box next to Enable G-SYNCSound IssuesSound DriversDifferent sound issues can be the result of outdated sound drivers, so the first thing to make sure of is that you have the most recent drivers installed.You can find Realtek drivers right here, and the drivers for any other audio devices in the manufacturer's website.Sound not recorded at allIf you can't hear any sound at all in your captured videos, you may have one of the following software running and conflicting with Overwolf: Nahimic, Alienware Sound Center or Asus Sonic Radar. Please close them when recording with Overwolf to avoid any issues.Only recording input sound, output sounds (game, music, etc.) are missingIf you have recently updated your Windows OS, and have since been having trouble capturing your system's output sounds, you should try the solution presented here: How “Windows Sonic” Spatial Sound Works.This issue can also be caused due to incompatibility between certain headset models and Overwolf's capture engine.Not recording friends' voices from DiscordIf you have a SteelSeries Arctis or HyperX headset with chat/game sound balance, and you can't hear your friends' voices on Discord in your captured videos (only your own voice and other sounds from your system) you can fix this issue by changing settings in Discord.The SteelSeries Arctis and HyperX headsets are using two different channels to output sound, while Overwolf's capture engine can only record one channel at a time.In order for your friends' voices to be recorded too, you will need to open up Discord's settings window, go to \"Voice & Video\", and change the \"Output Device\" to \"Arctis 7 Game\" or \"HyperX [Model Name] Game\":Unsupported Sound Format IssueWhen trying to use any of Overwolf's video recording apps with a specific sound format, you may encounter an error that says \"Unsupported sound format issue\". This issue may occur when using some kind of USB headset/microphone or a webcam microphone, and to solve it you should change the Default Format setting of your playback/recording device to \"Tape Recorder\".Microphone sound only heard from left/rightIf the sound recorded from your microphone can only be heard from one side (left or right), please check your microphone's channel setting:Right-click the speaker icon in your task barSelect 'Recording devices'Right-click your microphone from the list of devicesSelect 'Properties'Go to 'Advanced'Under 'Default Format' make sure the option '1 channel, 16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality)' is selectedClick 'Apply' and 'OK', and try to record your gameplay againNVIDIA Broadcast issuesPlease note that using NVIDIA Broadcast may cause audio issues when recording.Additionally, enabling the NVIDIA Broadcast Noise Removal feature will remove all game noise effects.Videos Not Captured At AllGPU DriversIf your gameplay videos are not being captured at all, you should first check whether your graphics card's drivers are up to date.Outdated drivers may prevent your graphics card's encoder from working properly (the encoders are essential for the capturing process), and as a result you might experience different issues with the capturing process.Please make sure that your drivers are up to date by visiting your graphics card's developer's website:AMDNvidia IntelOnce you update your drivers it's important to restart your PC (in order for the changes to be applied) before you try to capture videos again.SHT Compatibility ModeIf your videos only show black frames, and you have both an integrated GPU and a dedicated GPU, please enable the 'Shared texture compatibility mode' option in Overwolf's capture settings:Switchable DevicesHaving switchable devices in your systems means that different programs can run on different graphics cards (usually the integrated one or the dedicated one).When Overwolf's capture engine is running on one graphics card, and the game is running on the other - it can result in a black screen capture, or no videos being captured at all.The solution is to set Overwolf's capture engine to run on your dedicated graphics card, the same one that the game is running on. This is how you can do that:Legacy:NvidiaRecording Minimum Requirements ▾The following are the minimum requirements for recording with Overwolf apps (having a setup with lower specs may cause issues):Intel CPU: Intel i3 processors that support the Intel Quick Sync encoder. For the supported processors list, click here.AMD CPU: AMD Ryzen processors that support the AMF encoder (integrated Vega graphics unit).*OR*GPU: Versions of Nvidia graphics cards that support the NVENC encoder (GT/M versions might not work).Users with AMD graphics cards can try the AMF encoder, check the supported cards here.RAM: 8GB or more of RAM (16GB recommended!)For more information, please visit the following article: Overwolf Recording Minimum Requirements.Ransomware Protection Blocking RecordingWhen the Windows Ransomware Protection is enabled it may block Overwolf apps from recording. You can test if Windows Ransomware Protection is blocking Overwolf by temporarily disabling it under the Windows Security settings:If disabling the Windows Ransomware Protection resolves the issue you can click on \"Protected folder\" and set your media folder as an exception or set the media folder to an unprotected folder. If you are using Outplayed you can change the media folder using this guide: How to change the Outplayed Media folder DPI / Offset IssuesDoes the app's overlay look too big in-game? Is your cursor mislocated from where you actually click?These issues could be the result of having your DPI set higher than 100%, and the solution is setting it back to that scale in the display settings of Windows. To find out how you can change your DPI setting, please visit the following article: How to Scale down your DPI.Another option that cause an offset is the system's text size. To change it, please open the system settings > 'Ease of Access' > 'Display', and lower the text size to minimum.Recordings appearing brighter than in-gameIf your recordings are appearing brighter than the game please verify that any HDR setting has been disabled and restart the computer.If you are running an AMD graphic card please verify that the \"10-Bit Pixel Format\" setting is disabled and that the computer has been restarted: \n\t",

If there is an additional .NET Framework version in the list, as seen in the screenshot below, make sure that it is ticked as well:5. Restart your system (if asked to) and try to launch the Overwolf installer again.If the .NET Framework 3.5 feature is already enabled, you may going to need reinstall the higher .NET Framework version (4.8) installed on your system. For more information, please visit this article.Overwolf setup installer ▾If the above-mentioned solutions did not help you overcome the issue, please try to run the setup installer.It comes in a zipped file, so you will first need to extract it by using any program like WinZip, WinRAR or 7-Zip.Once the installation is complete you can go ahead and start downloading awesome apps for your games!Clean reinstall Overwolf client ▾If all of the above does not work, and you are still unable to install Overwolf, then try doing a full clean sweep of all Overwolf files, then try to re-install it. To uninstall Overwolf just go to: Start -> Control Panel -> Uninstall a Program and uninstall Overwolf.Once you finish uninstalling, head to C:\\Program Files (x86) and check if you have an Overwolf folder (you shouldn't). Delete it, and proceed to do the following:Press the Windows key + RType: %localappdata%Press enterLook for a folder named 'Overwolf'Delete itOnce you finish, please re-download (choose your favorite app) and launch Overwolf.Installation file is getting removed ▾If the installation file is finished downloading but it's missing from your 'Downloads' folder, it usually means an antivirus or a download manager software are automatically deleting it. When clicking the file to run it, you may notice that the browser's download bar or page says the file is either 'Removed' or 'Failed - Download error'. For example:We've seen this happen to users who have SAntivirus/Segurazo installed (sometimes, without even their knowledge), but it might also happen with other software. To resolve the issue you can temporarily disable the antivirus software and redownload the installer. For more information, please visit this article.RivaTuner conflict ▾RivaTuner Statistics Server is a hardware monitoring program that usually comes bundled with MSI Afterburner. Sometimes, it may conflict with Overwolf and prevent it from running properly (or running at all). To prevent any such issues, please follow the suggestions in our Overwolf and Conflicts with RivaTuner article, or close RivaTuner entirely for the duration of the installation (you may need to close MSI Afterburner first).Issue not resolved? Try running the Overwolf Troubleshooter!If it doesn't resolve the issue please click on Create Logs Zip and then Contact Support to open a support ticket with your log files so we can further investigate the matter.Having trouble launching Overwolf after installation?

    "body": "If you're experiencing any performance issues with your game, that are related to the system's FPS, CPU or memory, and you suspect it might be related to Overwolf, please have a look at the following list of causes and solutions:Take me to...Outdated DriversVideo CapturingRivaTuner Statistics ServerMouse Polling/Report RateMinimum RequirementsOutdated DriversFirst and foremost, it's important to make sure that your drivers are up to date. This includes your:Graphics card's driversSound driversWindows OSIf you install any drivers updates, you should restart your PC in order for the changes to be applied.Video CapturingIf you're using any Overwolf apps that capture videos of your gameplay, it's possible that the capturing process is causing performance issues.The process of capturing videos of your gameplay uses different system resources; RAM, CPU and GPU. These same resources are also responsible for running your game. This is why some effect on the game's FPS can be expected, but it's usually very minor and unnoticeable.In case you're experiencing a significant effect on your game's performance, it's best to make sure that:Your system meets the minimum capturing requirementsYour graphics card's drivers are up to dateYou have the correct codec set in Overwolf's capture settingsYour encoding preset is set to \"Default\" or \"Automatic\"Your FPS and resolution capturing settings are not set too high (according to your system's specs)You don't have any other video capturing/streaming programs running at the same time, like OBS or Nvidia ShadowPlayRivaTuner Statistics ServerRivaTuner Statistics Server is a software that usually comes bundled with the MSI Afterburner. It can conflict with Overwolf when both are running at the same time, and result in significant performance issues, game crashes and Overwolf crashes as well.No worries, though - you can follow the suggested solutions in our \"Overwolf and Conflicts with RivaTuner\" article, to resolve the conflict and have both Overwolf and RivaTuner running at the same time without any interruptions.Mouse Polling/Report RatePolling Rate (or Report Rate) is the at which data is transferring from the mouse to the system, and can be usually set up through the device's software (like Logitech G HUB, CORSAIR iCUE, Razer Synapse, etc.).We've found that in some cases, high polling/report rates (starting from 500Hz and higher) may cause performance issues (dropping FPS, mostly) that can seem to be related to overlays in general or to Overwolf's overlay specifically.We have found that in some cases the issue is resolved by installing the latest chipset drivers, according to your motherboard.Minimum RequirementsWe try to keep it simple, but there are some minimum requirements in order to run Overwolf properly:Operating System: Minimum: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)*Windows 7 is no longer supported.

Please restart to try again\".How to overcome this issue?One way would be to close RivaTuner while you're using Overwolf in games, but if you don't wish to completely close it, you can update it to version 7.2.3 (or higher) and change the program's settings as follows:Set \"Application detection level\" to \"Low\"Set \"Stealth mode\" to \"OFF\"Set \"Custom Direct3D support\" to \"OFF\"Set \"On-Screen Display coordinate space\" to \"Framebuffer\"The second way would be adding Overwolf.exe to the \"Application profile properties\" and changing the \"Application detection level\" to \"None\":\n\t",

    "title": "What is Overwolf: Overwolf Support",
    "body": "Overwolf is a platform that allows gamers to create and use in-game apps. These apps can provide a variety of features, such as live game stats, video recording, and mod management.Overwolf is free to use, but some apps may require a subscription fee.Take me to...What are Overwolf apps?What kind of apps are there?What can these apps do for me?Is it safe?How much does it cost?So how do you make money?Will your apps slow my computer down?Which games do you support?Can I develop my own App?What are Overwolf apps?An Overwolf app is a program designed to enhance the gaming experience by providing additional features and functionality in one or more games. These apps can include things like in-game overlays, recording and sharing functions, voice communication tools, and game-specific tools and statistics. Apps can be downloaded and installed through the Overwolf Appstore.Once you have installed Overwolf and the apps you want to use, starting the game will start the apps as well. Overwolf Settings allows you to control which apps launch automatically (right-click the Overwolf tray icon and choose Settings).Using the relevant hotkey, you can show or hide any running apps, and use them at your leisure. Hotkeys can be configured in the settings window.What kind of apps are there?There are various types of apps available on the Overwolf app store, which can be broadly categorized into the following categories:Game-Specific OverlayThese apps provide in-game overlays and tools that are tailored to a specific game. For example, an overlay that shows your team's location in a first-person shooter game or an app that provides real-time statistics and information about your character in a massively multiplayer online role-playing game.Game Recording and Video SharingThere are apps that allow you to record and share your gameplay, such as Outplayed for example.Game UtilitiesThese apps provide useful tools and information to help players improve their gameplay. For example, an app that displays your ping and fps or one that helps you track your progress and achievements in a game.Game statistics trackingThese apps allow you to track your statistics and performance in games, like showing you your win rate, damage dealt and received, and more.These are just some examples of the types of apps available on the Overwolf app store, and new apps are being developed all the time.What can these apps do for me?With all of these functionality options, apps can enhance your gameplay in various ways, from giving you an edge in esports, a helping hand in an MMO, or helping you capture and share some sick plays with your friends and followers online.And, of course, if you have some basic coding knowledge and a solid idea, Overwolf apps can be your ticket to a new profitable career as an in-game creator.Is it safe?YESApps on the overwolf platform comply with all safety and privacy laws and regulations. Before an app is uploaded to the app store, we make sure that it is functioning properly, safe to use and does not contain any inappropriate content.How much does it cost?Apps on the Overwolf Appstore are free (although some offer a subscription premium account as well) and meant to be enjoyed by everyone. So how do you make money?Within every app, a small section at the bottom of the screen is dedicated to monetizing the app, giving the developer a chance to earn an income by allowing ads in that section. While most of the revenue goes to the developers, Overwolf keeps a small percentage, and that is how we generate revenue. It is important to note that Overwolf does not sell any user data! The privacy of our players is of utmost concern to us, and we make sure it is very well protected. Will your apps slow my computer down?Overwolf apps are designed never to harm FPS, ping, or cause any performance issues. By providing developers with the lightest and most efficient ways to create an overlay and receive telemetry, we can make sure the games themselves are not compromised in any way, while the developers can focus on creating the best possible apps. Which games do you support?We support hundreds of games, and are constantly working to add more top games to the list. Check out our supported games list to learn more.Can I develop my own App?You bet! Visit https://overwolf.github.io/, download the SDK, and get coding! Our funding and support services may be able to assist you if your concept is solid, but you need assistance translating it into an app, or if the project is too big to tackle by yourself.Once your app is ready, let us know, and we'll publish it in the Appstore so the rest of the world can enjoy your creation!\n\t",

So for example, you can set the Browser app's hotkey to Ctrl+B in CS:GO, and set it to Ctrl+A in Apex Legends.In addition, you can assign a certain hotkey in different games, and it will control a different app in each of them.*The default hotkey for Overwolf's dock is Ctrl + Tab.To assign / unassign hotkeys follow these steps:Go to your Overwolf settings (wrench icon on your Overwolf dock, or right click the Overwolf tray icon and choose \"Settings\")Navigate to the \"Overlay & Hotkeys\" tab on the left menuChoose a game from the list that you wish to edit they hotkeys for Click on the existing hotkey combination for a specific app for that game, and press the combination of your choiceIf you wish to unassign a hotkey, just hover over it and click on the \"X\" button when it appearsYou may also choose to assign a specific hotkey to all the game (only for global apps, which support more than one game, like the Browser), just hover over it and click on the arrow icon when it appears.\n\t",

Some of those may not have an internal switch to control this, so we’re handing you the power to override this auto launch or allow it.Even if the permission is disabled, you can still activate any app manually from the dock (Ctrl+Tab in-game).FPS IndicatorEnable to see the in-game FPS meter, and select in which corner of the screen it appears.HotkeysEach app's set of hotkeys is managed separately per game. This means you can assign a different hotkey combination for the same app in different games, and you can assign one specific hotkey combination for different apps in different games.

    "title": "Performance Issues (FPS, CPU, Memory): Overwolf Support",
    "body": "If you're experiencing any performance issues with your game, that are related to the system's FPS, CPU or memory, and you suspect it might be related to Overwolf, please have a look at the following list of causes and solutions:Take me to...Outdated DriversVideo CapturingRivaTuner Statistics ServerMouse Polling/Report RateMinimum RequirementsOutdated DriversFirst and foremost, it's important to make sure that your drivers are up to date. This includes your:Graphics card's driversSound driversWindows OSIf you install any drivers updates, you should restart your PC in order for the changes to be applied.Video CapturingIf you're using any Overwolf apps that capture videos of your gameplay, it's possible that the capturing process is causing performance issues.The process of capturing videos of your gameplay uses different system resources; RAM, CPU and GPU. These same resources are also responsible for running your game. This is why some effect on the game's FPS can be expected, but it's usually very minor and unnoticeable.In case you're experiencing a significant effect on your game's performance, it's best to make sure that:Your system meets the minimum capturing requirementsYour graphics card's drivers are up to dateYou have the correct codec set in Overwolf's capture settingsYour encoding preset is set to \"Default\" or \"Automatic\"Your FPS and resolution capturing settings are not set too high (according to your system's specs)You don't have any other video capturing/streaming programs running at the same time, like OBS or Nvidia ShadowPlayRivaTuner Statistics ServerRivaTuner Statistics Server is a software that usually comes bundled with the MSI Afterburner. It can conflict with Overwolf when both are running at the same time, and result in significant performance issues, game crashes and Overwolf crashes as well.No worries, though - you can follow the suggested solutions in our \"Overwolf and Conflicts with RivaTuner\" article, to resolve the conflict and have both Overwolf and RivaTuner running at the same time without any interruptions.Mouse Polling/Report RatePolling Rate (or Report Rate) is the at which data is transferring from the mouse to the system, and can be usually set up through the device's software (like Logitech G HUB, CORSAIR iCUE, Razer Synapse, etc.).We've found that in some cases, high polling/report rates (starting from 500Hz and higher) may cause performance issues (dropping FPS, mostly) that can seem to be related to overlays in general or to Overwolf's overlay specifically.We have found that in some cases the issue is resolved by installing the latest chipset drivers, according to your motherboard.Minimum RequirementsWe try to keep it simple, but there are some minimum requirements in order to run Overwolf properly:Operating System: Minimum: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)*Windows 7 is no longer supported. It may still work for you, but please note that we will not be able to provide support in case you encounter any issues when running Overwolf on this operating system.  350MB on your hard driveIn-game support: DirectX 8, DirectX 9, DirectX 11, DirectX12 and OpenGLMicrosoft .NET Framework 4.8CPU:Minimum: Intel or AMD quad-core CPU Recommend: Intel i3/i5/i7 Gen7 CPU or AMD Ryzen 1Gen with 3 GHz or higher frequencyRAM: Minimum: 8GBRecommend: 16GBIf your system specs are below these requirements, it is most likely that it's not strong enough to handle Overwolf, and running it may result in performance issues.Still having trouble? Please contact us and we will do our best to help!\n\t",

    "title": "What is Overwolf: Overwolf Support",
    "body": "Overwolf is a platform that allows gamers to create and use in-game apps. These apps can provide a variety of features, such as live game stats, video recording, and mod management.Overwolf is free to use, but some apps may require a subscription fee.Take me to...What are Overwolf apps?What kind of apps are there?What can these apps do for me?Is it safe?How much does it cost?So how do you make money?Will your apps slow my computer down?Which games do you support?Can I develop my own App?What are Overwolf apps?An Overwolf app is a program designed to enhance the gaming experience by providing additional features and functionality in one or more games. These apps can include things like in-game overlays, recording and sharing functions, voice communication tools, and game-specific tools and statistics. Apps can be downloaded and installed through the Overwolf Appstore.Once you have installed Overwolf and the apps you want to use, starting the game will start the apps as well. Overwolf Settings allows you to control which apps launch automatically (right-click the Overwolf tray icon and choose Settings).Using the relevant hotkey, you can show or hide any running apps, and use them at your leisure. Hotkeys can be configured in the settings window.What kind of apps are there?There are various types of apps available on the Overwolf app store, which can be broadly categorized into the following categories:Game-Specific OverlayThese apps provide in-game overlays and tools that are tailored to a specific game. For example, an overlay that shows your team's location in a first-person shooter game or an app that provides real-time statistics and information about your character in a massively multiplayer online role-playing game.Game Recording and Video SharingThere are apps that allow you to record and share your gameplay, such as Outplayed for example.Game UtilitiesThese apps provide useful tools and information to help players improve their gameplay. For example, an app that displays your ping and fps or one that helps you track your progress and achievements in a game.Game statistics trackingThese apps allow you to track your statistics and performance in games, like showing you your win rate, damage dealt and received, and more.These are just some examples of the types of apps available on the Overwolf app store, and new apps are being developed all the time.What can these apps do for me?With all of these functionality options, apps can enhance your gameplay in various ways, from giving you an edge in esports, a helping hand in an MMO, or helping you capture and share some sick plays with your friends and followers online.And, of course, if you have some basic coding knowledge and a solid idea, Overwolf apps can be your ticket to a new profitable career as an in-game creator.Is it safe?YESApps on the overwolf platform comply with all safety and privacy laws and regulations. Before an app is uploaded to the app store, we make sure that it is functioning properly, safe to use and does not contain any inappropriate content.How much does it cost?Apps on the Overwolf Appstore are free (although some offer a subscription premium account as well) and meant to be enjoyed by everyone. So how do you make money?Within every app, a small section at the bottom of the screen is dedicated to monetizing the app, giving the developer a chance to earn an income by allowing ads in that section. While most of the revenue goes to the developers, Overwolf keeps a small percentage, and that is how we generate revenue. It is important to note that Overwolf does not sell any user data! The privacy of our players is of utmost concern to us, and we make sure it is very well protected. Will your apps slow my computer down?Overwolf apps are designed never to harm FPS, ping, or cause any performance issues. By providing developers with the lightest and most efficient ways to create an overlay and receive telemetry, we can make sure the games themselves are not compromised in any way, while the developers can focus on creating the best possible apps. Which games do you support?We support hundreds of games, and are constantly working to add more top games to the list. Check out our supported games list to learn more.Can I develop my own App?You bet! Visit https://overwolf.github.io/, download the SDK, and get coding! Our funding and support services may be able to assist you if your concept is solid, but you need assistance translating it into an app, or if the project is too big to tackle by yourself.Once your app is ready, let us know, and we'll publish it in the Appstore so the rest of the world can enjoy your creation!\n\t",

    "title": "Performance Issues (FPS, CPU, Memory): Overwolf Support",
    "body": "If you're experiencing any performance issues with your game, that are related to the system's FPS, CPU or memory, and you suspect it might be related to Overwolf, please have a look at the following list of causes and solutions:Take me to...Outdated DriversVideo CapturingRivaTuner Statistics ServerMouse Polling/Report RateMinimum RequirementsOutdated DriversFirst and foremost, it's important to make sure that your drivers are up to date. This includes your:Graphics card's driversSound driversWindows OSIf you install any drivers updates, you should restart your PC in order for the changes to be applied.Video CapturingIf you're using any Overwolf apps that capture videos of your gameplay, it's possible that the capturing process is causing performance issues.The process of capturing videos of your gameplay uses different system resources; RAM, CPU and GPU. These same resources are also responsible for running your game. This is why some effect on the game's FPS can be expected, but it's usually very minor and unnoticeable.In case you're experiencing a significant effect on your game's performance, it's best to make sure that:Your system meets the minimum capturing requirementsYour graphics card's drivers are up to dateYou have the correct codec set in Overwolf's capture settingsYour encoding preset is set to \"Default\" or \"Automatic\"Your FPS and resolution capturing settings are not set too high (according to your system's specs)You don't have any other video capturing/streaming programs running at the same time, like OBS or Nvidia ShadowPlayRivaTuner Statistics ServerRivaTuner Statistics Server is a software that usually comes bundled with the MSI Afterburner. It can conflict with Overwolf when both are running at the same time, and result in significant performance issues, game crashes and Overwolf crashes as well.No worries, though - you can follow the suggested solutions in our \"Overwolf and Conflicts with RivaTuner\" article, to resolve the conflict and have both Overwolf and RivaTuner running at the same time without any interruptions.Mouse Polling/Report RatePolling Rate (or Report Rate) is the at which data is transferring from the mouse to the system, and can be usually set up through the device's software (like Logitech G HUB, CORSAIR iCUE, Razer Synapse, etc.).We've found that in some cases, high polling/report rates (starting from 500Hz and higher) may cause performance issues (dropping FPS, mostly) that can seem to be related to overlays in general or to Overwolf's overlay specifically.We have found that in some cases the issue is resolved by installing the latest chipset drivers, according to your motherboard.Minimum RequirementsWe try to keep it simple, but there are some minimum requirements in order to run Overwolf properly:Operating System: Minimum: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)*Windows 7 is no longer supported. It may still work for you, but please note that we will not be able to provide support in case you encounter any issues when running Overwolf on this operating system.  350MB on your hard driveIn-game support: DirectX 8, DirectX 9, DirectX 11, DirectX12 and OpenGLMicrosoft .NET Framework 4.8CPU:Minimum: Intel or AMD quad-core CPU Recommend: Intel i3/i5/i7 Gen7 CPU or AMD Ryzen 1Gen with 3 GHz or higher frequencyRAM: Minimum: 8GBRecommend: 16GBIf your system specs are below these requirements, it is most likely that it's not strong enough to handle Overwolf, and running it may result in performance issues.Still having trouble? Please contact us and we will do our best to help!\n\t",

Try the Overlay Troubleshooting.I can’t download / install Overwolf, help! ▾Keep calm and don’t panic! Try the following steps here.I installed Overwolf but it won't run! ▾First, please make sure that your Windows operating system is up to date. If you have updates to install please do so, and make sure to restart your system afterwards. If your Windows is up to date, it's most likely that the issue is with the .NET Framework. Check this article for additional information.There is no sound when I record a video / the video is not playing, what should I check? ▾Updating your sound card driver is extremely important in order to record properly with Overwolf so please make sure to update your drivers.Please also make sure that your PC sound options are adjusted, and that your headset / speakers are plugged in and not disabled.You can check your sound settings by right clicking your volume tray icon and heading to \"sounds\", navigate between the playback / recording tabs and make sure your devices are enabled and adjusted.For more information on sound recording issues, please visit this article.How do I report errors / bugs? ▾Right click the Overwolf tray icon and select \"Support\".

The update will be installed on the next time you launch Overwolf. You can always update it manually by following these steps:Head into the \"Settings\" menuClick \"About\"Click \"Check for updates\"Click \"Relaunch\"If there is any issue with updating Overwolf please try the steps Here.Overwolf does not launch on system startup! ▾Please open Overwolf's installation directory (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Overwolf by default) and make sure that the files 'Overwolf.exe' and 'OverwolfLauncher.exe' are not set to run as an administrator:If there is still any issue please try running the Overwolf Troubleshooter.CompatibilityWhat are Overwolf's minimum requirements? ▾Operating System: Minimum: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)*Windows 7 is no longer supported. It may still work for you, but please note that we will not be able to provide support in case you encounter any issues when running Overwolf on this operating system.350MB on your hard driveIn-game support: DirectX 8, DirectX 9, DirectX 11, DirectX12 and OpenGLMicrosoft .Net 4.8CPU:Minimum: Intel or AMD quad-core CPU Recommend: Intel i3/i5/i7 Gen7 CPU or AMD Ryzen 1Gen with 3 GHz or higher frequencyRAM: Minimum: 8GBRecommend: 16GBOur goal is for Overwolf to run efficiently on your CPU and Video card. If your PC runs a game perfectly, it should easily support Overwolf.Note: Overwolf was not tested on VMs (Virtual Machines) and as such we cannot guarantee that Overwolf and Overwolf apps will work correctly when installed on a VM.Do you support macOS? ▾No, we only support Windows.Does Overwolf support dual screen setups? ▾Overwolf does not support dual screen setups. Overwolf can only be placed upon the main monitor and the last game you launch. We are considering support for dual monitors for the future.Why doesn't Overwolf work with any game streaming services?If you're streaming games via services like GeForce Now, Stadia, etc. - Overwolf's overlay will not work for you. This is because Overwolf must have a locally-running game process in order to be able to overlay on top of it.My Nvidia overlay starts recording a video when I launch Overwolf! ▾﻿We are aware of this issue and have found that it happens when the recording hotkey setting is empty.We have notified Nvidia about this, and until a permanent fix is deployed, the workaround solution is to simply assign a hotkey so the setting does not remain empty. This can be done by following these steps:Open GeForce ExperienceClick the 'Settings' button:Click the 'Settings' button under 'In-Game Overlay' or press Alt+Z:Click 'Keyboard shortcuts':Scroll down untill you reach the 'Record' section and the 'Toggle manual recording on/off and save' option in it:If the field is empty, simply click on it and assign any hotkey of your choice (the default is Shift+F9):Click 'Done' and that's it!\n\t",

Please restart to try again\".How to overcome this issue?One way would be to close RivaTuner while you're using Overwolf in games, but if you don't wish to completely close it, you can update it to version 7.2.3 (or higher) and change the program's settings as follows:Set \"Application detection level\" to \"Low\"Set \"Stealth mode\" to \"OFF\"Set \"Custom Direct3D support\" to \"OFF\"Set \"On-Screen Display coordinate space\" to \"Framebuffer\"The second way would be adding Overwolf.exe to the \"Application profile properties\" and changing the \"Application detection level\" to \"None\":\n\t",

To fix this issue, please install the latest available updates for your Windows OS. To check for available updates for your system, please click here.If you're still experiencing the same issue after updating your system, please try to run the setup installer instead.Installation stuck on \"Extracting Files\" ▾If Overwolf's installer keeps getting stuck on \"Extracting Files\" please try to run the setup installer instead.Installer displayed incorrectly ▾In certain cases the installer may appear 'broken' and it will be displayed incorrectly. If that happens, please contact us.Installer showing a \"Connection Error\" ▾This issue is commonly caused by the following:An anti-virus/firewall/VPN that might block the communication with the Overwolf serversMake sure to white-list Overwolf.Corrupted machine.config filePlease follow these steps to repair it:Go to C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\Open the 'v2.0.50727' folder then 'config'Override 'machine.config' with 'machine.config.default' (delete the 'machine.config' file, duplicate the 'machine.config.default' file and rename it to 'machine.config') Open the 'v4.0.30319' folder then 'config'Override 'machine.config' with 'machine.config.default' (delete the 'machine.config' file, duplicate the 'machine.config.default' file and rename it to 'machine.config')Go to C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\ and repeat steps a-dOverwolf server malfunction or downtimePlease try again after a while, just to make sure it's not a temporary issue.Weak/Unstable Wi-Fi connection that disconnects every now and thenConnect your internet via cable or make sure your Wi-Fi connection is stable.The connection is blocked by your ISP (internet service provider)Reach out to your ISP to find out how to remove the block.Installer not starting / finishing properly ▾Overwolf is based on .NET Framework, and at times, the installed .NET component in your system may malfunction and prevent the Overwolf installer from running properly.First, please make sure that the basic .NET Framework 3.5 feature is installed and enabled:Open the system's Control PanelSelect \"Programs\" or \"Programs and Features\" (depending on the view setting):Select \"Turn Windows features on or off\":Make sure that the checkbox for \".NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0)\" is ticked. If there is an additional .NET Framework version in the list, as seen in the screenshot below, make sure that it is ticked as well:5. Restart your system (if asked to) and try to launch the Overwolf installer again.If the .NET Framework 3.5 feature is already enabled, you may going to need reinstall the higher .NET Framework version (4.8) installed on your system. For more information, please visit this article.Overwolf setup installer ▾If the above-mentioned solutions did not help you overcome the issue, please try to run the setup installer.It comes in a zipped file, so you will first need to extract it by using any program like WinZip, WinRAR or 7-Zip.Once the installation is complete you can go ahead and start downloading awesome apps for your games!Clean reinstall Overwolf client ▾If all of the above does not work, and you are still unable to install Overwolf, then try doing a full clean sweep of all Overwolf files, then try to re-install it. To uninstall Overwolf just go to: Start -> Control Panel -> Uninstall a Program and uninstall Overwolf.Once you finish uninstalling, head to C:\\Program Files (x86) and check if you have an Overwolf folder (you shouldn't). Delete it, and proceed to do the following:Press the Windows key + RType: %localappdata%Press enterLook for a folder named 'Overwolf'Delete itOnce you finish, please re-download (choose your favorite app) and launch Overwolf.Installation file is getting removed ▾If the installation file is finished downloading but it's missing from your 'Downloads' folder, it usually means an antivirus or a download manager software are automatically deleting it. When clicking the file to run it, you may notice that the browser's download bar or page says the file is either 'Removed' or 'Failed - Download error'. For example:We've seen this happen to users who have SAntivirus/Segurazo installed (sometimes, without even their knowledge), but it might also happen with other software. To resolve the issue you can temporarily disable the antivirus software and redownload the installer. For more information, please visit this article.RivaTuner conflict ▾RivaTuner Statistics Server is a hardware monitoring program that usually comes bundled with MSI Afterburner. Sometimes, it may conflict with Overwolf and prevent it from running properly (or running at all). To prevent any such issues, please follow the suggestions in our Overwolf and Conflicts with RivaTuner article, or close RivaTuner entirely for the duration of the installation (you may need to close MSI Afterburner first).Issue not resolved? Try running the Overwolf Troubleshooter!If it doesn't resolve the issue please click on Create Logs Zip and then Contact Support to open a support ticket with your log files so we can further investigate the matter.Having trouble launching Overwolf after installation?

Try the Overlay Troubleshooting.I can’t download / install Overwolf, help! ▾Keep calm and don’t panic! Try the following steps here.I installed Overwolf but it won't run! ▾First, please make sure that your Windows operating system is up to date. If you have updates to install please do so, and make sure to restart your system afterwards. If your Windows is up to date, it's most likely that the issue is with the .NET Framework. Check this article for additional information.There is no sound when I record a video / the video is not playing, what should I check? ▾Updating your sound card driver is extremely important in order to record properly with Overwolf so please make sure to update your drivers.Please also make sure that your PC sound options are adjusted, and that your headset / speakers are plugged in and not disabled.You can check your sound settings by right clicking your volume tray icon and heading to \"sounds\", navigate between the playback / recording tabs and make sure your devices are enabled and adjusted.For more information on sound recording issues, please visit this article.How do I report errors / bugs? ▾Right click the Overwolf tray icon and select \"Support\".

The update will be installed on the next time you launch Overwolf. You can always update it manually by following these steps:Head into the \"Settings\" menuClick \"About\"Click \"Check for updates\"Click \"Relaunch\"If there is any issue with updating Overwolf please try the steps Here.Overwolf does not launch on system startup! ▾Please open Overwolf's installation directory (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Overwolf by default) and make sure that the files 'Overwolf.exe' and 'OverwolfLauncher.exe' are not set to run as an administrator:If there is still any issue please try running the Overwolf Troubleshooter.CompatibilityWhat are Overwolf's minimum requirements? ▾Operating System: Minimum: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)*Windows 7 is no longer supported. It may still work for you, but please note that we will not be able to provide support in case you encounter any issues when running Overwolf on this operating system.350MB on your hard driveIn-game support: DirectX 8, DirectX 9, DirectX 11, DirectX12 and OpenGLMicrosoft .Net 4.8CPU:Minimum: Intel or AMD quad-core CPU Recommend: Intel i3/i5/i7 Gen7 CPU or AMD Ryzen 1Gen with 3 GHz or higher frequencyRAM: Minimum: 8GBRecommend: 16GBOur goal is for Overwolf to run efficiently on your CPU and Video card. If your PC runs a game perfectly, it should easily support Overwolf.Note: Overwolf was not tested on VMs (Virtual Machines) and as such we cannot guarantee that Overwolf and Overwolf apps will work correctly when installed on a VM.Do you support macOS? ▾No, we only support Windows.Does Overwolf support dual screen setups? ▾Overwolf does not support dual screen setups. Overwolf can only be placed upon the main monitor and the last game you launch. We are considering support for dual monitors for the future.Why doesn't Overwolf work with any game streaming services?If you're streaming games via services like GeForce Now, Stadia, etc. - Overwolf's overlay will not work for you. This is because Overwolf must have a locally-running game process in order to be able to overlay on top of it.My Nvidia overlay starts recording a video when I launch Overwolf! ▾﻿We are aware of this issue and have found that it happens when the recording hotkey setting is empty.We have notified Nvidia about this, and until a permanent fix is deployed, the workaround solution is to simply assign a hotkey so the setting does not remain empty. This can be done by following these steps:Open GeForce ExperienceClick the 'Settings' button:Click the 'Settings' button under 'In-Game Overlay' or press Alt+Z:Click 'Keyboard shortcuts':Scroll down untill you reach the 'Record' section and the 'Toggle manual recording on/off and save' option in it:If the field is empty, simply click on it and assign any hotkey of your choice (the default is Shift+F9):Click 'Done' and that's it!\n\t",

Please restart to try again\".How to overcome this issue?One way would be to close RivaTuner while you're using Overwolf in games, but if you don't wish to completely close it, you can update it to version 7.2.3 (or higher) and change the program's settings as follows:Set \"Application detection level\" to \"Low\"Set \"Stealth mode\" to \"OFF\"Set \"Custom Direct3D support\" to \"OFF\"Set \"On-Screen Display coordinate space\" to \"Framebuffer\"The second way would be adding Overwolf.exe to the \"Application profile properties\" and changing the \"Application detection level\" to \"None\":\n\t",

If there is an additional .NET Framework version in the list, as seen in the screenshot below, make sure that it is ticked as well:5. Restart your system (if asked to) and try to launch the Overwolf installer again.If the .NET Framework 3.5 feature is already enabled, you may going to need reinstall the higher .NET Framework version (4.8) installed on your system. For more information, please visit this article.Overwolf setup installer ▾If the above-mentioned solutions did not help you overcome the issue, please try to run the setup installer.It comes in a zipped file, so you will first need to extract it by using any program like WinZip, WinRAR or 7-Zip.Once the installation is complete you can go ahead and start downloading awesome apps for your games!Clean reinstall Overwolf client ▾If all of the above does not work, and you are still unable to install Overwolf, then try doing a full clean sweep of all Overwolf files, then try to re-install it. To uninstall Overwolf just go to: Start -> Control Panel -> Uninstall a Program and uninstall Overwolf.Once you finish uninstalling, head to C:\\Program Files (x86) and check if you have an Overwolf folder (you shouldn't). Delete it, and proceed to do the following:Press the Windows key + RType: %localappdata%Press enterLook for a folder named 'Overwolf'Delete itOnce you finish, please re-download (choose your favorite app) and launch Overwolf.Installation file is getting removed ▾If the installation file is finished downloading but it's missing from your 'Downloads' folder, it usually means an antivirus or a download manager software are automatically deleting it. When clicking the file to run it, you may notice that the browser's download bar or page says the file is either 'Removed' or 'Failed - Download error'. For example:We've seen this happen to users who have SAntivirus/Segurazo installed (sometimes, without even their knowledge), but it might also happen with other software. To resolve the issue you can temporarily disable the antivirus software and redownload the installer. For more information, please visit this article.RivaTuner conflict ▾RivaTuner Statistics Server is a hardware monitoring program that usually comes bundled with MSI Afterburner. Sometimes, it may conflict with Overwolf and prevent it from running properly (or running at all). To prevent any such issues, please follow the suggestions in our Overwolf and Conflicts with RivaTuner article, or close RivaTuner entirely for the duration of the installation (you may need to close MSI Afterburner first).Issue not resolved? Try running the Overwolf Troubleshooter!If it doesn't resolve the issue please click on Create Logs Zip and then Contact Support to open a support ticket with your log files so we can further investigate the matter.Having trouble launching Overwolf after installation?

Only the game will be recorded.Note: Desktop capture will record everything that's displayed on the desktop - that means all Overwolf windows as well.Issues with OpenGLCurrently, OpenGL games don’t support the ‘All, except the video recorder’ option, and selecting this option will record all of Overwolf’s windows. If you’re playing an OpenGL game, you can either switch to DirectX (when available) or choose one of the other two window capture options”.OpenGL games supported by Overwolf:Awesomenauts (DX9 available)Broken AgeCounter-Strike 1.6Counter-Strike: Condition ZeroDarkest DungeonEuro Truck Simulator 2 (DX9 available)Farming Simulator 2013Farming Simulator 2015 (DX9 available)Heroes of Newerth (DX9 available)MapleStory (DX9 available)MinecraftOblitusPapers; PleasePrison ArchitectProject ZomboidQuake LiveRuneScape (DX9 available)Tales from the Borderlands (DX9 available)The Binding of Isaac: RebirthTransistorTrove (DX11 available)\n\t",

For the supported processors list, click here.AMD CPU: AMD Ryzen processors that support the AMF encoder (integrated Vega graphics unit).Additionally, check the AMD product page for your graphic card and verify that you have H.264 & H.265 available.*OR*GPU: Versions of Nvidia graphics cards that support the NVENC NEW encoder (GT/M versions might not work) and are running driver versions 500 and above. You can check your NVIDIA driver version using the steps here.Users with AMD graphics cards can try the AMF encoder, check the supported cards here.RAM: 8GB or more of RAM (16GB recommended!)*Please note that video capture cards are currently not supported for recording with Overwolf.You will not be able to select a video capture card as an audio source or as an encoder, and it will not show up as a device either.This information is based on user experience and Overwolf optimization.Feel free to contact Overwolf support team if you require any further assistance, our team will gladly help you!\n\t",

    "title": "Activating Intel Quick Sync: Overwolf Support",
    "body": "What is Intel Quick Sync?Intel Quick Sync is Intel’s hardware video encoding and decoding technology integrated into some of its CPU's. This encoder will take the job of encoding your video stream from your CPU and use the Intel integrated graphics card instead. Quick Sync was introduced with the Sandy Bridge CPU micro-architecture on 9 January 2011. You can use Intel Quick Sync if you have an integrated graphics card by following the guide below.How do I enable Intel Quick Sync?If the option for Intel Quick Sync is not enabled in the Overwolf settings, please proceed to do the following:Check here if your CPU supports the Intel Quick Sync technology.If your CPU does not support this, you can not use this encoder.Make sure your motherboard is supported via Intel integrated graphics card (iGPU).For example, the P67 series motherboard does not allow use of the iGPU and therefore cannot use Quick Sync.Once you have determined that you own a CPU and motherboard that supports Intel Quick Sync, please do the following:Enable your Intel Integrated graphics (iGPU) in your BIOS.Refer to your motherboard's user manual on how to access and configure this option, you can follow this guide here (take note that the BIOS settings may vary between manufacturers, so please check your manufacturer's website and manuals to make sure you are doing it correctly, since we simply can not provide instructions for various set-ups).Install the latest chip-set drivers for your motherboard and CPU so your iGPU is up to date (click here to download the latest update).Right click on your desktop and click on “Display Settings”:Select the “Detect” button to find inactive displays:Choose the display that correlates to your Intel HD Graphics (this will be one of the windows shown as “Another display not detected”) and click on “Try to connect anyway”:Click on “Apply” to save the changes.Select your main display and choose “Extend desktop to this display”:Click on “Apply” and a when a popup window shows select “Keep changes”Now that we enabled your Intel Quick-Sync it's time to make sure the encoder is working in Overwolf:Open up your Overwolf settings (the little wrench icon)Click on the \"Capture\" tabClick on \"Advanced\"Scroll down to the \"Encoding\" optionClick on the drop down arrow and choose \"Intel Quick Sync\"Try to record a video with one of the capturing apps\n\t",

Nvidia’s NVENC was introduced with the Nvidia GeForce GTX 600 series graphics cards in March 2012.How do I enable Nvidia NVENC?If the option for NVENC is not enabled in Overwolf's capture setting, please make sure that you have the following:An Nvidia GeForce GTX 600 series or higher graphics card (check the next section for a guide).Recent Nvidia drivers. Please check here if your drivers are up to date.If you do not own an Nvidia GPU that supports the NVENC encoding, this encoder will not be available to you. How do I know if my Nvidia graphics card supports NVENC encoding?We have found this guide to be the most accurate and helpful.Nvidia NVENC Errors\"Disabled Nvidia device or unsupported/old\"Explanation:Make sure your device is enabled through the device manager, or select a different encoder from our settings.\"Please update video card driver or change selected video encoder\"Explanation:This error message is received when your driver for the selected encoder is out of date.If you are using one of the hardware based encoders please update your drivers accordingly (check for driver updates for Nvidia GPUs here).If you do not wish to update your drivers, you can always swap to the x264 software encoder to record at any time (note that this may affect your recording quality).\"Unknown error occurred\"Explanation:Please consider changing the encoder via the Overwolf Capture Settings page:Open the Overwolf settings menuNavigate to \"Capture\"Click on \"Advanced\"Under \"Encoding\" select a different encoderQuick Sync > NvidiaChoose x264 if other options are unavailable*Note - If you own an AMD GPU you can follow the same steps and choose the AMD AMF encoder insteadPlease help us solve this issue by contacting our support: Overwolf Support.\n\t",

However, it will use your CPU and choosing this can often result in faulty videos as the CPU has a hard time running the capturing process in addition to all the other system tasks.Hardware encoders, such as Intel Quick Sync or Nvidia NVENC are only available to computer systems that have the appropriate hardware components.If you think you have the hardware to utilize one of the hardware-based encoders but do not know how to enable them, please click the above links.\n\t",

    "title": "Common Capture Issues: Overwolf Support",
    "body": "When capturing videos with Overwolf you may encounter certain issues. We've collected several common ones, and added explanations and solutions so you could solve these issues on your own :)Game Highlights and Apps are Currently DownOccasionally you may come across a Tweet or an in-app status message that indicate that highlights and apps are currently down. In this case, your highlights will not be captured automatically, however you can still capture manual videos of the game.You don't need to do anything; this situation will be resolved on it's own. We only ask for your patience until we finish patching things up and bring the highlights and apps back to work!For more information, please visit the following article: Apps and Highlights Status Explanation.Take me to...Stuttering/Lagging/Freezing VideosGPU DriversCodecsPresetsHigh Quality SettingsHardware-accelerated GPU schedulingWindows Game OptionsAMD Ryzen ProcessorSoftware/App CoexistenceSound IssuesSound DriversSound not recorded at allOnly recording input sound, output sounds (game, music, etc.) are missingNot recording friends' voices from DiscordUnsupported Sound Format IssueMicrophone sound only heard from left/rightNVIDIA Broadcast issuesVideos Not Captured At AllGPU DriversSHT Compatibility ModeSwitchable DevicesRecording Minimum Requirements ▾Ransomware Protection Blocking RecordingDPI / Offset IssuesRecordings appearing brighter than in-gameStuttering/Lagging/Freezing VideosGPU DriversIf you're experiencing stuttering (frame loss) in your captured videos, unsynced audio and video, videos freezing on one frame, or no video capturing at all your graphics card's drivers may be out of date.Outdated drivers may prevent your graphics card's encoder from working properly (the encoders are essential for the capturing process), and as a result you might experience different issues with the capturing process.Please make sure that your drivers are up to date by visiting your graphics card's developer's website:AMDNvidia IntelOnce you update your drivers it's important to restart your PC (in order for the changes to be applied) before you try to capture videos again.CodecsThe best capturing results can usually be achieved by selecting a codec that uses your dedicated GPU for the encoding process. Other codecs, mainly the x264, use your CPU.Choosing a CPU based codec often result in faulty videos because the CPU has a hard time running the capturing process in addition to all the other system tasks.The codec can be changed through the recording app settings or Overwolf's Capture settings:If your graphics card's encoder is unavailable (grayed out) despite having the latest drivers, you can take a deeper-effective measure and try a clean driver install.For more information on encoders, please visit the articles in the following category: Codecs.PresetsCertain presets may use more of your systems resources, and result in faulty video recordings. Please make sure to have your preset option set to either \"Default\" or \"Automatic\" and try to record again.High Quality SettingsIf your capturing quality settings (resolution, FPS) are set higher than what your system can handle, it will result in faulty videos. You should try to lower the capturing resolution and FPS before launching the game, and then check if the results have improved.Hardware-accelerated GPU schedulingWindows 10's new version, 2004 (build 19041), includes a new graphics setting: Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling. When turned on, this setting may interfere with Overwolf's OBS-based capture engine and cause various issues with the capturing process and the resulted videos. Turning this setting off can help overcome these issues.Windows 11:If you prefer to keep the Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling enabled, you can try to switch the game's display mode from 'Fullscreen' to 'Windowed'/'Windowed Borderless' in order to eliminate lags/dropped frames.Windows Game OptionsDisabling the following options, through the system settings, can improve the recording:Xbox Game BarBackground recordingGame Mode AMD Ryzen ProcessorIf you have an AMD Ryzen processor, you should try updating your system's BIOS, as we've seen it can solve the issue. You will need to enter your motherboard's manufacturer's website and follow the steps according to your specific motherboard model.Software/App CoexistenceIf you have any other video capturing/streaming software (like Nvidia ShadowPlay/NVIDIA Share/OBS Studio, for instance), streaming process or live wallpaper engine (Such as Lively Wallpaper/Wallpaper Engine) running at the same time as your Overwolf capturing app, this may affect the resulting video, or even prevent Overwolf's app from capturing your gameplay entirely.Please disable or close the relevant software and try to capture your gameplay again with your Overwolf app.Lastly, please make sure that you are not using the recording features of multiple Overwolf apps at the same time as this may cause issues in the recordings. Examples of Overwolf apps with recording features:AvatarBUFFGame CaptureGazoomInsights CaptureMedalNuked.TVOutplayedValorant Tracker (TRN)Replay HUDReplays.lolNvidia G-SYNCPlease note that running Nvidia G-SYNC may also cause issues with recording. You can disable it using the following steps:Right-click on your desktop and click on “Nvidia Control Panel” from the menuClick on the “+” next to DisplaySelect Set up G-SYNCUncheck the box next to Enable G-SYNCSound IssuesSound DriversDifferent sound issues can be the result of outdated sound drivers, so the first thing to make sure of is that you have the most recent drivers installed.You can find Realtek drivers right here, and the drivers for any other audio devices in the manufacturer's website.Sound not recorded at allIf you can't hear any sound at all in your captured videos, you may have one of the following software running and conflicting with Overwolf: Nahimic, Alienware Sound Center or Asus Sonic Radar. Please close them when recording with Overwolf to avoid any issues.Only recording input sound, output sounds (game, music, etc.) are missingIf you have recently updated your Windows OS, and have since been having trouble capturing your system's output sounds, you should try the solution presented here: How “Windows Sonic” Spatial Sound Works.This issue can also be caused due to incompatibility between certain headset models and Overwolf's capture engine.Not recording friends' voices from DiscordIf you have a SteelSeries Arctis or HyperX headset with chat/game sound balance, and you can't hear your friends' voices on Discord in your captured videos (only your own voice and other sounds from your system) you can fix this issue by changing settings in Discord.The SteelSeries Arctis and HyperX headsets are using two different channels to output sound, while Overwolf's capture engine can only record one channel at a time.In order for your friends' voices to be recorded too, you will need to open up Discord's settings window, go to \"Voice & Video\", and change the \"Output Device\" to \"Arctis 7 Game\" or \"HyperX [Model Name] Game\":Unsupported Sound Format IssueWhen trying to use any of Overwolf's video recording apps with a specific sound format, you may encounter an error that says \"Unsupported sound format issue\". This issue may occur when using some kind of USB headset/microphone or a webcam microphone, and to solve it you should change the Default Format setting of your playback/recording device to \"Tape Recorder\".Microphone sound only heard from left/rightIf the sound recorded from your microphone can only be heard from one side (left or right), please check your microphone's channel setting:Right-click the speaker icon in your task barSelect 'Recording devices'Right-click your microphone from the list of devicesSelect 'Properties'Go to 'Advanced'Under 'Default Format' make sure the option '1 channel, 16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality)' is selectedClick 'Apply' and 'OK', and try to record your gameplay againNVIDIA Broadcast issuesPlease note that using NVIDIA Broadcast may cause audio issues when recording.Additionally, enabling the NVIDIA Broadcast Noise Removal feature will remove all game noise effects.Videos Not Captured At AllGPU DriversIf your gameplay videos are not being captured at all, you should first check whether your graphics card's drivers are up to date.Outdated drivers may prevent your graphics card's encoder from working properly (the encoders are essential for the capturing process), and as a result you might experience different issues with the capturing process.Please make sure that your drivers are up to date by visiting your graphics card's developer's website:AMDNvidia IntelOnce you update your drivers it's important to restart your PC (in order for the changes to be applied) before you try to capture videos again.SHT Compatibility ModeIf your videos only show black frames, and you have both an integrated GPU and a dedicated GPU, please enable the 'Shared texture compatibility mode' option in Overwolf's capture settings:Switchable DevicesHaving switchable devices in your systems means that different programs can run on different graphics cards (usually the integrated one or the dedicated one).When Overwolf's capture engine is running on one graphics card, and the game is running on the other - it can result in a black screen capture, or no videos being captured at all.The solution is to set Overwolf's capture engine to run on your dedicated graphics card, the same one that the game is running on. This is how you can do that:Legacy:NvidiaRecording Minimum Requirements ▾The following are the minimum requirements for recording with Overwolf apps (having a setup with lower specs may cause issues):Intel CPU: Intel i3 processors that support the Intel Quick Sync encoder. For the supported processors list, click here.AMD CPU: AMD Ryzen processors that support the AMF encoder (integrated Vega graphics unit).*OR*GPU: Versions of Nvidia graphics cards that support the NVENC encoder (GT/M versions might not work).Users with AMD graphics cards can try the AMF encoder, check the supported cards here.RAM: 8GB or more of RAM (16GB recommended!)For more information, please visit the following article: Overwolf Recording Minimum Requirements.Ransomware Protection Blocking RecordingWhen the Windows Ransomware Protection is enabled it may block Overwolf apps from recording. You can test if Windows Ransomware Protection is blocking Overwolf by temporarily disabling it under the Windows Security settings:If disabling the Windows Ransomware Protection resolves the issue you can click on \"Protected folder\" and set your media folder as an exception or set the media folder to an unprotected folder. If you are using Outplayed you can change the media folder using this guide: How to change the Outplayed Media folder DPI / Offset IssuesDoes the app's overlay look too big in-game? Is your cursor mislocated from where you actually click?These issues could be the result of having your DPI set higher than 100%, and the solution is setting it back to that scale in the display settings of Windows. To find out how you can change your DPI setting, please visit the following article: How to Scale down your DPI.Another option that cause an offset is the system's text size. To change it, please open the system settings > 'Ease of Access' > 'Display', and lower the text size to minimum.Recordings appearing brighter than in-gameIf your recordings are appearing brighter than the game please verify that any HDR setting has been disabled and restart the computer.If you are running an AMD graphic card please verify that the \"10-Bit Pixel Format\" setting is disabled and that the computer has been restarted: \n\t",

You will get this error if you attempt to record your desktop while in an \"Active Game\" recording mode.To fix this error, you can do the following:Enter your game and then press the record button again.In Overwolf’s settings, change ‘Record active game’ to ‘Record monitor’. This way, everything that is displayed on your monitor will be recorded (regardless of being in game or out of it).Please update video card driver or change selected video encoderThis error message will appear when your driver for the selected encoder is out of date.If you are using one of the hardware based encoders (Nvidia NVENC, AMD AMF, or Intel Quick Sync) please update your drivers accordingly.For Nvidia drivers, click hereFor AMD drivers, click hereFor Intel Quick Sync, click here*Make sure to perform a full system restart after installing the updates, otherwise the changes will not be applied and the error will persist.Additionally, please check that your graphic card meets the minimum recording requirements.Selected video settings are too high. Please lower the settings and retryThis error message will appear when your selected combination of Codec/Preset/Resolution/FPS settings is too demanding for your computer (lack of PC resources).Please try lowering the settings to find the optimal selection for your PC.If possible, we advise using one of the hardware encoders (Nvidia NVENC, AMD AMF, or Intel Quick Sync) as this will free up some computer resources and allow higher quality recording in some cases.Can’t write video to file / Can't create videos foldeThis error message will appear when Overwolf has no permissions to create or add files at the target location. To fix this error you will need to completely uninstall Overwolf and re-install it: How to Re-Install Overwolf with a Clean Slate.If possible make sure to create a backup of your recording files before uninstalling Overwolf.Recording not supported in this gameThis error message will appear when your current game is not supported by Overwolf or is supported by Overwolf but recording is disabled for it.Please check the supported games list which will show you which games are supported, and which games have recording disabled in them. If your game does not appear on that list or has recording disabled, please vote for your game to be supported or post on our forums for assistance.Another possible explanation is that the game you are trying to record runs on a DirectX 8 (DX8) render type, which is not supported by Overwolf.Insufficient hard drive space. Free up space or change target driveThis error message will appear when the hard drive specified in your video recorder settings has no more room to store additional files. To fix this error you can:Free up space by deleting or moving files from the hard drive to somewhere else (external hard drive, secondary hard drive, etc).Change the location where Overwolf saves the video files. To do this, please click on the wrench icon on the video recorder and under \"Video folder\" click on \"Browse\" or \"Change\" and choose a new destination.No video encoders foundThis error message will appear when Overwolf cannot find a video encoder (hardware or software).To fix this error you will need to completely uninstall Overwolf and re-install it: How to Re-Install Overwolf with a Clean Slate.If possible make sure to create a backup of your recording files before uninstalling Overwolf.If this does not solve the issue, please contact us and we will do our best to assist you!We don't know what happened. What did you break this time?This error message will appear when, well, when something went wrong and we don't know what it is. This shouldn't happen, but hey, we all make mistakes right? right?!? If this happens, please contact us and we will do our best to assist you!Recording is disabled while streamingCurrently, Overwolf cannot stream and record at the same time due to technical limitations. We will be adding this feature in the future, but until then please either record or stream.Recorder not availableThis error message will appear when you try to interact with the recorder while it is busy (i.e. attempting to start a recording session).To fix this error you will need to close the video recorder and start it again or restart Overwolf.Recording in progress by another app. Stop the recording app and try againThis error will appear when you have another active app that is recording. Overwolf can only run 1 app at a time that can record.Please stop whatever other app that may be recording.System sound capture error/No Playback DeviceThis error can be related to a couple of issues, the most common one is the Razer Kraken headset compatibility issue.If it doesn't help please contact us and we will do our best to assist you!Missing system files ▾The mf.dll file is one of many DLL files that are installed along with Windows Media Player.We have found that in order to record videos properly, Windows has to have this DLL in its system files.

    "title": "Black Screen When Recording with Overwolf: Overwolf Support",
    "body": "Compatibility ModeThe compatibility mode in the Overwolf capture settings is meant to provide users with average gaming rigs a way to record their games and highlights. This mode basically forces your recorder to use a technology called 'shared memory' instead of the more advanced and graphically consuming 'shared texture'.This option is not meant to be used on high-end rigs (strong GPU/CPU) and can cause FPS issues and/or black screen recordings.  PC with both Intel Quicksync and Nvidia NVENCHaving both Quick Sync and NVENC (encoding technologies by new Intel processors and new Nvidia graphic cards) on your PC might affect the Overwolf recorder and cause black screen recordings.*NoteThe very first thing you can do is make sure that your graphics drivers are up to date (in case you have a GeForce card and are using NVENC).The issue seems to be related to which graphic card is assigned to Overwolf and your game. If your Overwolf capture settings are set to use the Intel on-board graphics card and the game is set to use the Nvidia graphics card, you will get a black screen instead of the gameplay you recorded when you watch the video file.To workaround this issue, please follow these steps:Launch OverwolfLaunch the Nvidia control panel (right click on the desktop)Open the Overwolf video recorder app and start recordingClick on \"Manage 3D settings\"Go to the \"Program Settings\" tab and click on \"Add\"Look for a program called \"Overlay\" (overwolfoverlayhelper.exe), select it and click on \"Add Selected Program\"Stop the video recordingMake sure the Overwolf overlay process uses the same graphics card as the game you're trying to record\n\t",

They may work in the preview however we are unable to provide further support regarding virtual cameras.How to capture only game soundOutplayed can be set to capture only the game sound. Using this setting means that your music, voice chat, or any other non-game sounds will not be recorded.You can find the \"System sound captures only the game\" setting in the Outplayed Capture settings under the Audio Advanced options:Please note that this setting is in beta and will not work if you are using a Windows version older then Windows 10 2004 (released 2020-05-27) or Outplayed games with no in-games overlay support.Note: When this setting is enabled it is not possible to record the Valorant voice chat as it is run through the Riot client and not the game process.How to force microphone capture to monoIf you are using an XLR microphone or any microphone that captures only one side you can set Outplayed to mono sound capture under the advanced options in the Outplayed Capture settings:How to set up Wave Link Stream (Elgato Wave) in OutplayedUnder the Outplayed Capture settings go to the Audio section and select the microphone device \"Wave Link Stream (Elgato Virtual Audio)\".

Additionally, it is automatically disabled for games with no in-game overlay support.What are “Before duration” and “After duration”The \"before duration\" is the amount of time Outplayed will record before pressing on the record hotkey. For example, if your before duration is 20 seconds once you press on your hotkey to record Outplayed will record for 20 seconds from before you press on the hotkey. Same goes for after duration, it will continue recording for the amount of time after pressing on the record hotkey.For example, if you click on record 1 minute into your game the recording will start from 0:40 not 1:00 when you click on the hotkey.Once you have changed this setting you can click on \"Apply globally to all games\" if you would like all your games recorded with Outplayed to use the same “Before duration” and “After duration”:When using the Full Session/Full Match Capture Modes the before duration setting refers to placing the bookmark. How to change the duration of your highlightsWhen selecting the Highlights Capture Mode you can set how long before and after each game event you would like each highlight to be captured for.

They may work in the preview however we are unable to provide further support regarding virtual cameras.How to capture only game soundOutplayed can be set to capture only the game sound. Using this setting means that your music, voice chat, or any other non-game sounds will not be recorded.You can find the \"System sound captures only the game\" setting in the Outplayed Capture settings under the Audio Advanced options:Please note that this setting is in beta and will not work if you are using a Windows version older then Windows 10 2004 (released 2020-05-27) or Outplayed games with no in-games overlay support.Note: When this setting is enabled it is not possible to record the Valorant voice chat as it is run through the Riot client and not the game process.How to force microphone capture to monoIf you are using an XLR microphone or any microphone that captures only one side you can set Outplayed to mono sound capture under the advanced options in the Outplayed Capture settings:How to set up Wave Link Stream (Elgato Wave) in OutplayedUnder the Outplayed Capture settings go to the Audio section and select the microphone device \"Wave Link Stream (Elgato Virtual Audio)\".

Additionally, it is automatically disabled for games with no in-game overlay support.What are “Before duration” and “After duration”The \"before duration\" is the amount of time Outplayed will record before pressing on the record hotkey. For example, if your before duration is 20 seconds once you press on your hotkey to record Outplayed will record for 20 seconds from before you press on the hotkey. Same goes for after duration, it will continue recording for the amount of time after pressing on the record hotkey.For example, if you click on record 1 minute into your game the recording will start from 0:40 not 1:00 when you click on the hotkey.Once you have changed this setting you can click on \"Apply globally to all games\" if you would like all your games recorded with Outplayed to use the same “Before duration” and “After duration”:When using the Full Session/Full Match Capture Modes the before duration setting refers to placing the bookmark. How to change the duration of your highlightsWhen selecting the Highlights Capture Mode you can set how long before and after each game event you would like each highlight to be captured for. It is possible to set the highlight to be captured for a maximum of 180 seconds before & after each game event.Note: When your game is set to record the Full Session/Full Match these settings can be used to change the length of the bookmark instead of the recording.You can change this setting by clicking on your game under the Games tab, clicking on Advanced Options and toggling the bars next to each event type:For example: In the gif above the settings for the Victory event have been changed so the highlight recorded by Outplayed will show 93 seconds before the Victory event takes place and 92 seconds after the event as well.Please make sure to restart Outplayed and your game to save any changes to these settings.What is a bookmark?Just like bookmarks in real life, creating a bookmark in Outplayed allows you to go back to the point you marked in the video.Bookmarks are represented by an icon on the timeline.

You may also cancel any subscription at any time from your Overwolf settings, causing these apps to revert to free-to-use mode at the end of your current subscription period.After subscribing you will receive two email messages: One from Xsolla (mailer@xsolla.com) with your receipt every 30 days One from Overwolf (team@overwolf.com) with your order information every 30 days as well Frequently Asked Questions (and Answers!)How can I subscribe to an app? ▾Once you've installed an app from the Appstore, the 'Subscribe' button will show up next to the app's 'Launch' button:If you don't see the 'Subscribe' button after installing an app, it means that it doesn't offer a subscription plan yet, but it may do so in the future.Can I subscribe using my credit card? ▾Yes, you can! Overwolf subscriptions use Xsolla as a payment provider, which lets you pay any way you choose.Where can I view my subscriptions? ▾You can view your subscriptions under Settings > Subscriptions in the Overwolf app.What is Xsolla? ▾Xsolla is a payments platform Overwolf has recently partnered with, providing game developers and publishers  with diverse (700+) payment options in a wide variety of languages and high security standards.When is my next payment? ▾Subscriptions charge every 30 days, counting from the day you made the first payment on.I can't see my subscriptions? ▾Please make sure that you are logged in to your Overwolf account. If you are unable to see your subscriptions after logging in please reach out to our support team. I subscribed to an app/mod creator on Patreon, is this the same? ▾As Patreon is not related to Overwolf these type of subscriptions will not gain any Overwolf subscription benefits.I subscribed to an external app, is this the same? ▾Some apps and app creators have external websites or desktop apps which do not run on Overwolf, and are out of our platform. These subscriptions will not gain any Overwolf subscription benefits and are unrelated to our products.How can I unsubscribe? ▾Canceling a subscription is just as easy as subscribing - just head to Overwolf’s settings, select the ‘Subscriptions’ tab and unsubscribe from any app instantly. You will still be able to enjoy premium features until the end of the current 30 days already subscribed.Can I use my subscription on multiple devices? ▾Absolutely! Subscriptions are bound to your Overwolf account, not to any specific PC, and you can use it across your devices. Note that abusing this or sharing your account with others can get flagged by automated tools that prevent it.Will paying a subscription remove ads from all Overwolf apps? ▾No. Subscriptions are a way to support an app creator directly, and get premium features for that particular app. Other Overwolf apps will not be affected in any way when subscribing or unsubscribing to a specific app.How can I get a refund? ▾If you encounter any issues or were billed wrongfully, please reach out to our support team.\n\t",

You may also cancel any subscription at any time from your Overwolf settings, causing these apps to revert to free-to-use mode at the end of your current subscription period.After subscribing you will receive two email messages: One from Xsolla (mailer@xsolla.com) with your receipt every 30 days One from Overwolf (team@overwolf.com) with your order information every 30 days as well Frequently Asked Questions (and Answers!)How can I subscribe to an app? ▾Once you've installed an app from the Appstore, the 'Subscribe' button will show up next to the app's 'Launch' button:If you don't see the 'Subscribe' button after installing an app, it means that it doesn't offer a subscription plan yet, but it may do so in the future.Can I subscribe using my credit card? ▾Yes, you can! Overwolf subscriptions use Xsolla as a payment provider, which lets you pay any way you choose.Where can I view my subscriptions? ▾You can view your subscriptions under Settings > Subscriptions in the Overwolf app.What is Xsolla? ▾Xsolla is a payments platform Overwolf has recently partnered with, providing game developers and publishers  with diverse (700+) payment options in a wide variety of languages and high security standards.When is my next payment? ▾Subscriptions charge every 30 days, counting from the day you made the first payment on.I can't see my subscriptions? ▾Please make sure that you are logged in to your Overwolf account. If you are unable to see your subscriptions after logging in please reach out to our support team. I subscribed to an app/mod creator on Patreon, is this the same? ▾As Patreon is not related to Overwolf these type of subscriptions will not gain any Overwolf subscription benefits.I subscribed to an external app, is this the same? ▾Some apps and app creators have external websites or desktop apps which do not run on Overwolf, and are out of our platform. These subscriptions will not gain any Overwolf subscription benefits and are unrelated to our products.How can I unsubscribe? ▾Canceling a subscription is just as easy as subscribing - just head to Overwolf’s settings, select the ‘Subscriptions’ tab and unsubscribe from any app instantly. You will still be able to enjoy premium features until the end of the current 30 days already subscribed.Can I use my subscription on multiple devices? ▾Absolutely! Subscriptions are bound to your Overwolf account, not to any specific PC, and you can use it across your devices. Note that abusing this or sharing your account with others can get flagged by automated tools that prevent it.Will paying a subscription remove ads from all Overwolf apps? ▾No. Subscriptions are a way to support an app creator directly, and get premium features for that particular app. Other Overwolf apps will not be affected in any way when subscribing or unsubscribing to a specific app.How can I get a refund? ▾If you encounter any issues or were billed wrongfully, please reach out to our support team.\n\t",

Do I need it to use Brawl Stats?What is my Brawl Stats player tag?Why are there ads / too many ads in the app?Can I pay to remove the ads in the app?I used the recommended brawlers but I didn’t win. Is this a bug?Where can I use Brawl Stats?I’m a YouTuber / streamer and wish to partner with Brawl StatsWhy isn’t the app available in my language?I would like to help translate Brawl Stats into my language. Who should I talk to?Can I see the next brawler I will get? ▾Sorry, but we don't know the next brawler you will get.Brawl Stats is just a companion app not related to the game company (Supercell).Can you give me gems? ▾No, we can't give you gems. It would be cool, but we are not related to the game company.Can you give me brawlers? ▾We can't, but we can give you useful stats and recommendations to help you win more so you can progress faster!I play all the time, but I didn’t get a legendary brawler! ▾Sorry to hear that, but we can't help you. Brawl Stats is a companion app, not the game, and we don't know when you'll get brawlers.Why can’t I see my trophy graph? ▾You should visit your profile on Brawl Stats for 5 days (doesn't have to be consecutive) before we get enough data to show your trophy graph.How are the recommended brawlers determined? ▾Recommended brawlers are picked after a process of meta-game study and game mechanics exploration by our partner KairosTime. You can check his video about recommended brawlers where he goes into more details on this topic.Why aren’t you showing recommended brawlers for ticketed events (such as “Robo Rumble”)? ▾We're constantly updating our apps and website with recommended brawlers. If you don't see anything for a specific event, we're working on it!My account is lost / hacked / blocked – can you help me? ▾We're sorry to hear that, but we are not related to the game's company. Please refer to the official Brawl Stars support page by Supercell.What is my Supercell ID? Do I need it to use Brawl Stats? ▾Supercell ID is an account system for Supercell games.

This is most likely normal: you need a minimum of 1000 trophies to have an Epic chest in your chest cycle. The same goes for Legendary chests, except the minimum is 2000 trophies.Where are the shop offers?A: We recently removed the shop offers at the request of Supercell. They wanted to keep some flexibility in them so they can make it more interesting for the players. It could come back later, we don't know! It's up to Supercell.Can I help translating Stats Royale into another language?A: We would love for you to help us out! Check out our project in Crowdin.

    "title": "The Masked Cards feature is going under construction",
    "body": "Dear IronVest Community,\nWe have some news to share with you regarding one of our most beloved features, Masked Cards. At IronVest, we are continuously working to provide you with the best possible experience, and that means constantly improving our offerings.\nTemporary Service Disruption\nStarting January 20, 2024, we'll be temporarily pausing our Masked Cards feature. We know this might be inconvenient, but please rest assured that this break is for a good cause. We plan to relaunch our services during Summer 2024, with exciting improvements.\nWhy the Pause?\nWe've identified areas in the Masked Card feature that can be enhanced to make it even more flexible, faster, and powerful. To achieve this, we're shifting the product onto modern, state-of-the-art financial technology infrastructure. It's all part of our commitment to delivering top-notch services to you.\nWhat It Means for You\nLast Chance to Generate New Cards: January 20, 2024, will be the final day to create new Masked Cards.\nBalances Deadline: Be sure to use any balances on your existing masked cards or close the cards & get a refund by January 20, 2024, to avoid an automatic refund to your funding source.\nEnhanced Masked Cards: When we relaunch, you'll have the opportunity to enjoy enhanced Masked Cards. You may be asked to provide personal details when setting up these new cards.\nA Token of Appreciation\nAs a token of our gratitude for your patience during this service interruption, we'll be extending premium subscriptions for every active Masked Card user of the feature for an additional 4 months at no cost to you. No action is required on your part – it will be applied automatically.\nFAQ\nQ1: Why are you doing this?\nA1: Your feedback means the world to us, and we've been in constant conversation with our valued customers (that's you!). We understand just how much you love Masked Cards, and we share that enthusiasm. However, we also recognize that there's ample room for improvement – from a better overall experience to adding more features that make your online shopping easier and more secure.\nTo make this vision a reality, we had to make a tough decision: upgrade our underlying infrastructure even though that means pausing for maintenance. This upgrade is essential to build the exceptional product you truly deserve. While this means a brief pause in Masked Cards functionality, it's all part of our commitment to delivering an even more outstanding experience.\nRest assured, this short maintenance period will lead to a relaunched service that brings enhanced functionality and an improved experience. We can't wait to share these exciting changes with you soon!\n \nQ2: How can I get the additional 4 months of premium service? Do I need to do anything?\nA2: You don't need to do anything – we've got you covered! We've automatically extended the renewal date of your license by 4 months. You can verify this in the settings page on the web-app under \"Plan.\" Enjoy the extra premium service on us!\n \nQ3: Can I still use my Open card? For how long could I use my existing card that has a balance?\nA3: You can continue using your open cards until January 20th.\n \nQ4: What happens to open cards after January 20?\nA4: After January 20th, any open cards will be automatically closed, and any remaining balances will be refunded back to their original funding source. Please note that any transactions attempted with these closed cards will be declined.\n \nQ5: Where will the refunded money go?\nA5: The refund will be credited back to the same payment method you used for funding the card.\n \nQ6: How do I know what funding source I used?\nA6: To find out which funding source you used to generate a specific Masked Card, you can refer to the email we sent you when the Masked Card was generated. If you have any difficulty or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to us at support@ironvest.com. We're here to help and can provide you with the information you need.\n \nQ7: How do I know how much open balance I have/how many open cards I have?\nA7: You can easily access this information by visiting your IronVest Pay App on the web or by checking your mobile app's Masked Card page. On the web, you can conveniently sort your cards by balance to see exactly how much you have.\n \nQ8: Are there any steps I need to take in preparation for the maintenance period?\nA8: Yes, to ensure a smooth transition during the maintenance period, we recommend removing your cards from any websites or platforms where you've set up card-on-file information (such as subscription services or e-commerce sites). This step will help prevent declined transactions and any inconvenience during the upgrade. Additionally, we recommend that you close your open cards yourself instead of waiting for the system to do it automatically for you. This proactive approach will give you better control over your accounts during this period.\n \nQ9: What happens to open or pending transactions when the maintenance period begins?\nA9: Approved authorizations as of January 20, 2024, will still settle as they were previously authorized.\n \nQ10: When will the new card product be available?\nA10: We are working diligently to bring you the enhanced card product, and our target is to launch it by the end of Summer 2024. Stay tuned for updates!\n \nQ11: Will I be notified when cards are available again?\nA11: Absolutely! We will notify you by email, and you'll also see notices on the web app, mobile app, and the extension to ensure you stay informed about the availability of cards.\n \nQ12: Will I still be able to receive refunds from the merchant on my Masked Cards after 1/20/2024? How do I recover them?A12: Yes, your Masked Cards will still receive refunds after 01/20/2024. To receive the refund back to your funding source, please contact us at support@ironvest.com\n            ",

    "title": "Troubleshooting Masked Email Forwarding: A Comprehensive Guide",
    "body": "\nMasked Emails are an excellent tool to protect your privacy. However, you might occasionally encounter issues, such as your Masked Emails not forwarding to your primary email address. Here's a breakdown of possible causes and how to fix them.\n1. Hard Bounces from Masked Email Addresses\nOne potential reason could be that your recent attempts to forward emails via your Masked Email addresses have resulted in \"hard bounces.\" A hard bounce refers to a permanent delivery failure of an email message due to:\nNon-existence of the target email address\nNon-existence of the domain name\nPermanent blockage of email delivery by the recipient's email server\nIn response to hard bounce notifications, we disable forwarding for all of your Masked Emails and prevent the creation of new Masked Emails. This protocol is to keep our bounce rates at a manageable level.\n2. Masked Emails Landing in Spam or Junk Mail\nAnother possibility could be the accidental activation of a spam filter for Masked Emails, causing forwarded Masked Emails to land directly in your spam or junk mail. If this is the case, consider the following steps to rectify the situation:\nAdd the domain \"@opayq.com\" to your \"Safe Senders\" list.\nCreate a filter for \"@opayq.com\" and choose the option that prevents matching email messages from being sent to spam.\nMark any emails with \"[Masked]\" in the \"from\" line as \"Not Spam.\"\nFor detailed instructions tailored to your email provider, refer to the following links:\nOutlook Instructions\nGmail Instructions\nYahoo Instructions\n3. Marking an Email from a Masked Email Address as \"Spam\"\nRemember that marking an email from a Masked Email address as \"spam\" can halt the reception of future Masked Emails. Instead, to stop a Masked Email address from forwarding to your inbox, just block that Masked Email from forwarding. Instructions on how to do this can be found on our FAQs page.\nIn conclusion, understanding these common issues and how to resolve them can help ensure the smooth operation of your Masked Emails and protect your online privacy. If after trying these fixes you still experience issues with your Masked Emails, please do not hesitate to contact our support team at support@ironvest.com. We're here to help!\n \n            ",

They gather your personal information, often through trickery, data breaches, or purchases on the dark web.\nOnce they control your number, they can receive your calls and texts. This is especially worrisome as many online services, like banking or social media, use text messages for added security, or two-factor authentication (2FA). Attackers can use this access to infiltrate your accounts, change passwords, steal money, or demand a ransom.\nIronVest's Passcode Protection comes to your rescue in such situations. This feature bolsters the security of your accounts that use 2FA. Instead of the 2FA code being sent to your personal number, IronVest intercepts it. After you pass IronVest's biometric verification, the code is then revealed, either being automatically filled in for you through a browser extension or displayed on the mobile app for easy copying and pasting. This security protocol ensures that your sensitive information remains shielded, even in the face of a SIM swap attack.\nRemember to be careful with your personal information, opt for non-text based 2FA when possible, and monitor your accounts regularly.

This fresh view includes a sleek modern design that not only elevates user experience but also strengthens app security and boosts performance.\nTo access the beta version, users can toggle on the Auto-fill Identities and/or Auto-fill Addresses from their existing profile pages. To ensure a smooth transition, the Access Guard and Pay App beta views will synchronize with the same toggle action, delivering a seamless transition and an improved user interface experience.\nImproved Stability and Fixes\nIn our commitment to provide the best user experience, we have addressed critical issues and implemented improvements:\nFixed an issue that was causing invalid zip code errors for users in Germany when filling out the payment form. This issue is now resolved, and users can complete payment forms without encountering these errors.\nCorrected a redirection problem where users were being redirected to the dashboard page when attempting to reactivate biometric protection. Now, when you disable and then re-enable biometric protection, you'll be directed to the appropriate biometrics activation page.\nWe have significantly improved the stability and robustness of our biometric infrastructure to ensure reliable and secure user authentication.\nWe're excited about these improvements and are always eager to hear your feedback as we continue to improve and enhance your experience with our web application.\n            ",

Instead of asterisks, the panel will now show \"Username Missing\", which is clickable to autofill the saved password.\nA 'fix' icon has been introduced that opens the account record in edit mode in a new tab, allowing rapid correction of incomplete information.\nWe've simplified the autofill instruction to \"Fill Password\", replacing the previous \"Fill Strong Password\" text. This update applies across all accounts.\nPasscode Protection Update:\nWe've optimized the OTP (One-Time Password) entry procedure as part of our passcode protection feature. After user authentication, the OTP will automatically populate in the designated field, eliminating the need for manual input via the \"fill code\" button.\nIn the event of an unsuccessful auto-fill, the \"Copy\" and \"Fill\" buttons will remain available for manual entry.\nBug Fixes:\nBiometric Verification Bug:\nWe've addressed an issue where disabling the biometric verification on card creation setting was not applying as expected.\nMinor Bugs:\nIn addition to the main bug fix, we've made several other minor bug fixes to improve performance and stability.\nWe encourage you to update to version 9.7.0 to take advantage of these improvements.
