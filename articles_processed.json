    "title": "The Masked Cards feature is going under construction",
    "body": "Dear IronVest Community,\nWe have some news to share with you regarding one of our most beloved features, Masked Cards. At IronVest, we are continuously working to provide you with the best possible experience, and that means constantly improving our offerings.\nTemporary Service Disruption\nStarting January 20, 2024, we'll be temporarily pausing our Masked Cards feature. We know this might be inconvenient, but please rest assured that this break is for a good cause. We plan to relaunch our services during Summer 2024, with exciting improvements.\nWhy the Pause?\nWe've identified areas in the Masked Card feature that can be enhanced to make it even more flexible, faster, and powerful. To achieve this, we're shifting the product onto modern, state-of-the-art financial technology infrastructure. It's all part of our commitment to delivering top-notch services to you.\nWhat It Means for You\nLast Chance to Generate New Cards: January 20, 2024, will be the final day to create new Masked Cards.\nBalances Deadline: Be sure to use any balances on your existing masked cards or close the cards & get a refund by January 20, 2024, to avoid an automatic refund to your funding source.\nEnhanced Masked Cards: When we relaunch, you'll have the opportunity to enjoy enhanced Masked Cards. You may be asked to provide personal details when setting up these new cards.\nA Token of Appreciation\nAs a token of our gratitude for your patience during this service interruption, we'll be extending premium subscriptions for every active Masked Card user of the feature for an additional 4 months at no cost to you. No action is required on your part – it will be applied automatically.\nFAQ\nQ1: Why are you doing this?\nA1: Your feedback means the world to us, and we've been in constant conversation with our valued customers (that's you!). We understand just how much you love Masked Cards, and we share that enthusiasm. However, we also recognize that there's ample room for improvement – from a better overall experience to adding more features that make your online shopping easier and more secure.\nTo make this vision a reality, we had to make a tough decision: upgrade our underlying infrastructure even though that means pausing for maintenance. This upgrade is essential to build the exceptional product you truly deserve. While this means a brief pause in Masked Cards functionality, it's all part of our commitment to delivering an even more outstanding experience.\nRest assured, this short maintenance period will lead to a relaunched service that brings enhanced functionality and an improved experience. We can't wait to share these exciting changes with you soon!\n \nQ2: How can I get the additional 4 months of premium service? Do I need to do anything?\nA2: You don't need to do anything – we've got you covered! We've automatically extended the renewal date of your license by 4 months. You can verify this in the settings page on the web-app under \"Plan.\" Enjoy the extra premium service on us!\n \nQ3: Can I still use my Open card? For how long could I use my existing card that has a balance?\nA3: You can continue using your open cards until January 20th.\n \nQ4: What happens to open cards after January 20?\nA4: After January 20th, any open cards will be automatically closed, and any remaining balances will be refunded back to their original funding source. Please note that any transactions attempted with these closed cards will be declined.\n \nQ5: Where will the refunded money go?\nA5: The refund will be credited back to the same payment method you used for funding the card.\n \nQ6: How do I know what funding source I used?\nA6: To find out which funding source you used to generate a specific Masked Card, you can refer to the email we sent you when the Masked Card was generated. If you have any difficulty or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to us at support@ironvest.com. We're here to help and can provide you with the information you need.\n \nQ7: How do I know how much open balance I have/how many open cards I have?\nA7: You can easily access this information by visiting your IronVest Pay App on the web or by checking your mobile app's Masked Card page. On the web, you can conveniently sort your cards by balance to see exactly how much you have.\n \nQ8: Are there any steps I need to take in preparation for the maintenance period?\nA8: Yes, to ensure a smooth transition during the maintenance period, we recommend removing your cards from any websites or platforms where you've set up card-on-file information (such as subscription services or e-commerce sites). This step will help prevent declined transactions and any inconvenience during the upgrade. Additionally, we recommend that you close your open cards yourself instead of waiting for the system to do it automatically for you. This proactive approach will give you better control over your accounts during this period.\n \nQ9: What happens to open or pending transactions when the maintenance period begins?\nA9: Approved authorizations as of January 20, 2024, will still settle as they were previously authorized.\n \nQ10: When will the new card product be available?\nA10: We are working diligently to bring you the enhanced card product, and our target is to launch it by the end of Summer 2024. Stay tuned for updates!\n \nQ11: Will I be notified when cards are available again?\nA11: Absolutely! We will notify you by email, and you'll also see notices on the web app, mobile app, and the extension to ensure you stay informed about the availability of cards.\n \nQ12: Will I still be able to receive refunds from the merchant on my Masked Cards after 1/20/2024? How do I recover them?A12: Yes, your Masked Cards will still receive refunds after 01/20/2024. To receive the refund back to your funding source, please contact us at support@ironvest.com\n            ",

    "title": "Troubleshooting Masked Email Forwarding: A Comprehensive Guide",
    "body": "\nMasked Emails are an excellent tool to protect your privacy. However, you might occasionally encounter issues, such as your Masked Emails not forwarding to your primary email address. Here's a breakdown of possible causes and how to fix them.\n1. Hard Bounces from Masked Email Addresses\nOne potential reason could be that your recent attempts to forward emails via your Masked Email addresses have resulted in \"hard bounces.\" A hard bounce refers to a permanent delivery failure of an email message due to:\nNon-existence of the target email address\nNon-existence of the domain name\nPermanent blockage of email delivery by the recipient's email server\nIn response to hard bounce notifications, we disable forwarding for all of your Masked Emails and prevent the creation of new Masked Emails. This protocol is to keep our bounce rates at a manageable level.\n2. Masked Emails Landing in Spam or Junk Mail\nAnother possibility could be the accidental activation of a spam filter for Masked Emails, causing forwarded Masked Emails to land directly in your spam or junk mail. If this is the case, consider the following steps to rectify the situation:\nAdd the domain \"@opayq.com\" to your \"Safe Senders\" list.\nCreate a filter for \"@opayq.com\" and choose the option that prevents matching email messages from being sent to spam.\nMark any emails with \"[Masked]\" in the \"from\" line as \"Not Spam.\"\nFor detailed instructions tailored to your email provider, refer to the following links:\nOutlook Instructions\nGmail Instructions\nYahoo Instructions\n3. Marking an Email from a Masked Email Address as \"Spam\"\nRemember that marking an email from a Masked Email address as \"spam\" can halt the reception of future Masked Emails. Instead, to stop a Masked Email address from forwarding to your inbox, just block that Masked Email from forwarding. Instructions on how to do this can be found on our FAQs page.\nIn conclusion, understanding these common issues and how to resolve them can help ensure the smooth operation of your Masked Emails and protect your online privacy. If after trying these fixes you still experience issues with your Masked Emails, please do not hesitate to contact our support team at support@ironvest.com. We're here to help!\n \n            ",

    "body": "SIM swap attacks occur when someone tricks your cell phone company into switching your phone number to their SIM card. They gather your personal information, often through trickery, data breaches, or purchases on the dark web.\nOnce they control your number, they can receive your calls and texts. This is especially worrisome as many online services, like banking or social media, use text messages for added security, or two-factor authentication (2FA). Attackers can use this access to infiltrate your accounts, change passwords, steal money, or demand a ransom.\nIronVest's Passcode Protection comes to your rescue in such situations. This feature bolsters the security of your accounts that use 2FA. Instead of the 2FA code being sent to your personal number, IronVest intercepts it. After you pass IronVest's biometric verification, the code is then revealed, either being automatically filled in for you through a browser extension or displayed on the mobile app for easy copying and pasting. This security protocol ensures that your sensitive information remains shielded, even in the face of a SIM swap attack.\nRemember to be careful with your personal information, opt for non-text based 2FA when possible, and monitor your accounts regularly.

This integration enhances payroll processing accuracy and efficiency by automating data transfer.\n \n \nPrerequisites \nIntegration Overview Authentication and Connection Setup \nData Access and Permission Management \nWorker Integration Logic\nOut of the box fields\nUsing the Integration\nData Imports Page\nUpdates and Maintenance\nFAQ\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPrerequisites \nBefore you start, ensure that you have Administrative Access: Full administrative privileges in both Papaya platform and SAP SuccessFactors. \n \n \n \n \nIntegration Overview \nThe integration process involves connecting Papaya platform with SAP SuccessFactors to synchronize key HR and PTO data fields. This synchronization is crucial for maintaining data consistency and accuracy in payroll processing. \nIntegration Mechanism \nSAML Authentication: Integration begins with Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication using the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol. This ensures that the exchange of data is conducted in a secure environment where the identity of the Papaya platform is verified by SAP SuccessFactors. \nAPI Protocol: Once authenticated, the Papaya platform utilizes SAP SuccessFactors' OData REST API for data transmission. The RESTful API design allows for a flexible, lightweight transfer of HR data in a structured format (such as JSON or XML), using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. \nSynchronization Options \nScheduled Synchronization: The Papaya platform can be configured to automatically perform data synchronization daily, at regular intervals according to the project’s time zone.  \nManual Synchronization: For immediate data updates, the platform provides an on-demand sync feature. This allows administrators to manually initiate the synchronization process at any time, bypassing the scheduled intervals. \nData Transfer Process \nSecure Connection: SAML-based authentication confirms the identity of the Papaya platform to SAP SuccessFactors, establishing a trusted link. \nData Exchange: Using the OData protocol, the relevant HR and PTO data is exchanged between the systems. The REST API's standard HTTP methods facilitate the creation, reading, updating, or deletion of records as needed. \nConfirmation: After the data exchange, the data is then updated and immediately reflected in the Papaya platform. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAuthentication and Connection Setup \nGenerate API Credentials: Follow the steps in the SAP SuccessFactors documentation to generate API credentials. SAP Documentation support page. \nConfigure in Papaya Platform: Enter these credentials in the integration settings section of Papaya Platform. \n Starting the Integration Wizard \nAccess the Papaya Platform: Log in and go to the Integrations page and select SAP SuccessFactors under the HRIS section.\nConnect to HR Data Integration: Click the 'Connect' button to launch the integration wizard. \nCertification Data: Copy the certificate in the connection step of the wizard.\nRegistering the Application in SAP SuccessFactors \nNavigate to the \"Manage OAuth2 Client Applications\" page within SAP SuccessFactors click \"Register Client Application\" to open the registration window. \nCertificate and Application Details: Paste the Papaya Certificate into the \"*X.509 Certificate\" field, set your application name and URL, and ensure the designated user has the necessary permissions. \nBinding the User to the API \nPermissions Verification: Ensure the user you bind to the API has comprehensive permissions to access all necessary worker and data information. \nApplication Registration: After entering all required details in SAP SuccessFactors, click \"Register\" to finalize the application registration. \nAPI Key Retrieval: Post-registration, click \"View\" in the resulting table to access and copy the API Key. \nConfiguring Papaya Integration Wizard \nEnter API Key: Return to the Papaya Integration Wizard and paste the copied API Key into the \"API Key\" field. \nComplete Required Fields: Fill in all remaining fields. These details are crucial for the successful integration of SAP SuccessFactors data with Papaya Platform. \nSave and Proceed: Click \"Save and Next\" to finalize the connection setup. This action saves your credentials and allows you to proceed to the next phase of the integration process. \nInitial Data Mapping \nMapping Overview: The mapping step is where you define how data from SAP SuccessFactors will correspond to fields within Papaya Platform. This ensures that the imported data is correctly organized and utilized. More on the mapping step can be found in section 6 of this guide. \nOptional Pause\n: If you're not ready to complete this step, click \"Cancel\" to exit. Your connection setup and credentials will be saved, allowing you to return and complete this step later. \nReview and Testing \nConnection Confirmation: Once the initial mapping is defined, you should see a connection screen indicating that the setup is complete and ready for data synchronization. \nData Synchronization Test: It's recommended to perform a test synchronization to ensure that data flows correctly from SAP SuccessFactors to Papaya Platform without any issues. \nFinal Steps \nAdjustments and Optimization: Based on the test results, you may need to adjust the mapping or connection settings for optimal data transfer. \nIntegration Completion: With the successful test and adjustments made, your integration setup is complete. You're now ready to utilize the seamless data flow between SAP SuccessFactors and Papaya Platform for enhanced HRIS capabilities. \n \n \n \n \nData Access and Permission Management \nFor enhanced data security and compliance with privacy regulations, the Papaya platform allows you to control which worker data is synchronized with SAP SuccessFactors. This is achieved by binding a user to the API connection with permissions tailored to the entities you wish to transfer. \nSetting Up Restricted Access \nCreate a Dedicated Integration User: In SAP SuccessFactors, create a user account specifically for the integration. This account will be used solely for API interactions between SAP SuccessFactors and the Papaya platform. \nAssign Limited Permissions: Assign permissions to this integration user that correspond only to the data entities they need access to. This should include only the relevant employees for payroll processing by Papaya Global.  \nBind the User to the API Connection: Within the integration setup on SAP SuccessFactors, bind this user to the API connection. This ensures that any data requests made through the Papaya platform are carried out under the authority of this user, adhering to the set permissions. \nManaging Permissions \nReview and Update Permissions Regularly: As your organizational structure or roles change, review and update the permissions of the integration user to reflect these changes. This ensures that only relevant data is accessible and synchronized. \nAudit Data Access: Periodically audit the data access logs to ensure that the integration user is only accessing the data within their permission scope. This practice helps maintain the integrity of your data security policies. \nData Synchronization with Restricted Access \nWith the integration user in place and permissions defined, the data synchronization process will only include the worker data that the user is authorized to access. Here’s how it impacts the data flow: \nFiltering Data: When a synchronization request is made, either manually or through a scheduled sync, the API will only retrieve or affect data entities that the integration user has permissions for. \nSecurity Compliance: This method ensures that your integration complies with internal data security policies and external regulatory requirements by only exchanging permitted data. \n \nWorker Integration Logic\nThis section outlines the logic used to determine which workers are integrated from SuccessFactors into our payroll platform. \nEligibility Criteria - Workers must meet the following criteria to be eligible for integration:\nActive or Recently Terminated Employment Status: Workers with an active employment status or those terminated within the last year are considered for integration. \nSnapshot Date Relevance: We take a snapshot of the data relevant to the current date. Workers with data types that have future start dates will not be integrated until their effective date is reached. \nEmployment Groups: All employment groups are integrated by default. Customers can adjust the permissions of the integration to send only specific employment groups if desired. \nEOR (Employer of Record) Workers \nCreation and Cost Plan Updates: We do not enable the creation of EOR workers or the creation and updates to their cost plans.\nHR Data and Salary Updates: For EOR workers, only the updating of HR data for existing workers and salary updates are enabled. \nExclusion Criteria - Workers that meet any of the following conditions are excluded from integration: \n Termination Date: Workers with a termination date that is in the previous fiscal year, unless they are sent in the first 3 months of the current fiscal year. \n  Adding Terminated workers to current cycle, needs to be handled by your local payroll team on the papaya platform\nMigrating workers between projects - this use case is not automated in the integration process. local payroll administrator should open a ticket on papaya 360 to accommodate this need. after the migration process will be completed the integration for this worker will continue to update the data.Saving Cost Plan Data in the integration \nCost Plan Data Rules \nSaved with the start date of the current open pay cycle.  effective date should be populated in SuccessFactors if the update is retroactive. if the change is retroactive an automatic comment will appear in the Salary updates file to the ICP. Each cost plan item requires an amount, number of instalments and currency.  To close a certain cost plan item please set an end date to the pay component.  \nData Requirements for Salaried and Hourly Workers:\nTo ensure accurate payroll processing, it's important to understand the different data requirements for salaried and hourly workers. \nDuring the discovery step of the integration Data mapping, inform Papaya global which of the fields from SuccessFactors that distinguish between salaried and hourly workers. \nSalaried Workers: base amount, frequency, Currency, Annualization factor, effective date. Hourly Workers: Base amount for each hourly rate. \nPlease note: for hourly workers, each cycle, the total number of hours worked at each rate should be integrated to papaya. This can be done by uploading a file from your T&A platform or in the Salary updates section on the Papaya Global platform.  \n \n \nOut of the box fields\nThe following are detailed mappings of some key fields: \nAppendix A – HR Data from SAP SuccessFactors to Papaya Platform.\nAppendix B – PTO Data from SAP SuccessFactors to Papaya Platform.\n \n \n \n \n \nUsing the Integration\nAfter setting up the integration: \nHR Data Management: Sync employee details such as names, IDs, and job titles. The synchronization process can be monitored in the integration dashboard. \nPTO Data Management: Automatically update leave balances and track leave requests in real-time. \n \n \n \n \nData Imports Page\nAfter data synchronization between SAP SuccessFactors and the Papaya platform, it's essential to review the import results to ensure accuracy and completeness of the imported data. \nAccessing Import Results \nNavigate to the Data Imports section under the Integrations tab in the Papaya platform. \nHere, you will find a list of all data import activities, including both HR data and PTO data synchronizations. \nUnderstanding Import Status \nSuccessful Upload: The data was imported without any issues. \nPartial Upload: Some data was imported, but there may be errors or warnings that need attention. \nFailed Upload: The import did not complete, and no data was imported due to errors. \nViewing Detailed Reports \nClick on a specific import entry to view detailed results. \nWithin the detailed view, you'll find sections such as Total Entries, Processed, Invalid Data, and Joiners & Leavers. \nValidating Data \nThe Validate Data area highlights any records with issues such as missing mandatory fields or invalid data. Errors must be addressed for the data to be correctly processed in future imports. \nImport Reports \nFor a comprehensive review, download the full import report by clicking the Download Report File button. \nThe report includes all entries, with detailed information on any data issues encountered during the import. \nSteps to Address Errors \nReview the text error descriptions provided in the report to understand the nature of the issues. \nFor straightforward issues, you can often correct the data directly in SAP SuccessFactors. \nRe-attempt the import after making the necessary corrections to verify that the issues have been resolved. \nWhen to Contact Support \nPapaya Support 360 is available 24/7\nIf the error messages are unclear or you're unable to resolve the issues based on the descriptions provided, reach out to the Papaya support team for assistance.  \nProvide specific details about the errors encountered and any steps you've already taken to try to resolve them.

All files uploaded through the Papaya SFTP server are encrypted in transit using a secure SSH connection.  \n \nAuthentication: \nThe authentication to the server is performed using a customer-generated public key. This secure authentication process validates the identity and access rights of users connecting to the server.  \n \nMulti-tenancy: \nPapaya is utilizing multi-tenancy architecture to ensure that each customer's data and resources remain isolated and separated.  \n \nIP Whitelisting: \nPapaya enforces customer IP whitelisting. Only specific customer IP addresses or predefined IP ranges are authorized to access the server. This restriction minimizes the risk of unauthorized access attempts from unknown or malicious sources. \n \nAccess Control: \nPapaya employs stringent access control measures based on the principle of least privilege. Access permissions are granted to users based on their job roles and responsibilities. \n \nVulnerability Scanning: \nTo identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the system, Papaya performs ongoing vulnerability scans.

    "body": "Overwolf is a platform that allows gamers to create and use in-game apps. These apps can provide a variety of features, such as live game stats, video recording, and mod management.Overwolf is free to use, but some apps may require a subscription fee.Take me to...What are Overwolf apps?What kind of apps are there?What can these apps do for me?Is it safe?How much does it cost?So how do you make money?Will your apps slow my computer down?Which games do you support?Can I develop my own App?What are Overwolf apps?An Overwolf app is a program designed to enhance the gaming experience by providing additional features and functionality in one or more games. These apps can include things like in-game overlays, recording and sharing functions, voice communication tools, and game-specific tools and statistics. Apps can be downloaded and installed through the Overwolf Appstore.Once you have installed Overwolf and the apps you want to use, starting the game will start the apps as well. Overwolf Settings allows you to control which apps launch automatically (right-click the Overwolf tray icon and choose Settings).Using the relevant hotkey, you can show or hide any running apps, and use them at your leisure. Hotkeys can be configured in the settings window.What kind of apps are there?There are various types of apps available on the Overwolf app store, which can be broadly categorized into the following categories:Game-Specific OverlayThese apps provide in-game overlays and tools that are tailored to a specific game. For example, an overlay that shows your team's location in a first-person shooter game or an app that provides real-time statistics and information about your character in a massively multiplayer online role-playing game.Game Recording and Video SharingThere are apps that allow you to record and share your gameplay, such as Outplayed for example.Game UtilitiesThese apps provide useful tools and information to help players improve their gameplay. For example, an app that displays your ping and fps or one that helps you track your progress and achievements in a game.Game statistics trackingThese apps allow you to track your statistics and performance in games, like showing you your win rate, damage dealt and received, and more.These are just some examples of the types of apps available on the Overwolf app store, and new apps are being developed all the time.What can these apps do for me?With all of these functionality options, apps can enhance your gameplay in various ways, from giving you an edge in esports, a helping hand in an MMO, or helping you capture and share some sick plays with your friends and followers online.And, of course, if you have some basic coding knowledge and a solid idea, Overwolf apps can be your ticket to a new profitable career as an in-game creator.Is it safe?YESApps on the overwolf platform comply with all safety and privacy laws and regulations. Before an app is uploaded to the app store, we make sure that it is functioning properly, safe to use and does not contain any inappropriate content.How much does it cost?Apps on the Overwolf Appstore are free (although some offer a subscription premium account as well) and meant to be enjoyed by everyone. So how do you make money?Within every app, a small section at the bottom of the screen is dedicated to monetizing the app, giving the developer a chance to earn an income by allowing ads in that section. While most of the revenue goes to the developers, Overwolf keeps a small percentage, and that is how we generate revenue. It is important to note that Overwolf does not sell any user data! The privacy of our players is of utmost concern to us, and we make sure it is very well protected. Will your apps slow my computer down?Overwolf apps are designed never to harm FPS, ping, or cause any performance issues. By providing developers with the lightest and most efficient ways to create an overlay and receive telemetry, we can make sure the games themselves are not compromised in any way, while the developers can focus on creating the best possible apps. Which games do you support?We support hundreds of games, and are constantly working to add more top games to the list. Check out our supported games list to learn more.Can I develop my own App?You bet! Visit https://overwolf.github.io/, download the SDK, and get coding! Our funding and support services may be able to assist you if your concept is solid, but you need assistance translating it into an app, or if the project is too big to tackle by yourself.Once your app is ready, let us know, and we'll publish it in the Appstore so the rest of the world can enjoy your creation!\n\t",

For example:We've seen this happen to users who have SAntivirus/Segurazo installed (sometimes, without even their knowledge), but it might also happen with other software. To resolve the issue you can temporarily disable the antivirus software and redownload the installer. For more information, please visit this article.RivaTuner conflict ▾RivaTuner Statistics Server is a hardware monitoring program that usually comes bundled with MSI Afterburner. Sometimes, it may conflict with Overwolf and prevent it from running properly (or running at all). To prevent any such issues, please follow the suggestions in our Overwolf and Conflicts with RivaTuner article, or close RivaTuner entirely for the duration of the installation (you may need to close MSI Afterburner first).Issue not resolved?

You can always update it manually by following these steps:Head into the \"Settings\" menuClick \"About\"Click \"Check for updates\"Click \"Relaunch\"If there is any issue with updating Overwolf please try the steps Here.Overwolf does not launch on system startup! ▾Please open Overwolf's installation directory (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Overwolf by default) and make sure that the files 'Overwolf.exe' and 'OverwolfLauncher.exe' are not set to run as an administrator:If there is still any issue please try running the Overwolf Troubleshooter.CompatibilityWhat are Overwolf's minimum requirements? ▾Operating System: Minimum: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)*Windows 7 is no longer supported. It may still work for you, but please note that we will not be able to provide support in case you encounter any issues when running Overwolf on this operating system.350MB on your hard driveIn-game support: DirectX 8, DirectX 9, DirectX 11, DirectX12 and OpenGLMicrosoft .Net 4.8CPU:Minimum: Intel or AMD quad-core CPU Recommend: Intel i3/i5/i7 Gen7 CPU or AMD Ryzen 1Gen with 3 GHz or higher frequencyRAM: Minimum: 8GBRecommend: 16GBOur goal is for Overwolf to run efficiently on your CPU and Video card. If your PC runs a game perfectly, it should easily support Overwolf.Note: Overwolf was not tested on VMs (Virtual Machines) and as such we cannot guarantee that Overwolf and Overwolf apps will work correctly when installed on a VM.Do you support macOS? ▾No, we only support Windows.Does Overwolf support dual screen setups? ▾Overwolf does not support dual screen setups. Overwolf can only be placed upon the main monitor and the last game you launch. We are considering support for dual monitors for the future.Why doesn't Overwolf work with any game streaming services?If you're streaming games via services like GeForce Now, Stadia, etc. - Overwolf's overlay will not work for you. This is because Overwolf must have a locally-running game process in order to be able to overlay on top of it.My Nvidia overlay starts recording a video when I launch Overwolf! ▾﻿We are aware of this issue and have found that it happens when the recording hotkey setting is empty.We have notified Nvidia about this, and until a permanent fix is deployed, the workaround solution is to simply assign a hotkey so the setting does not remain empty. This can be done by following these steps:Open GeForce ExperienceClick the 'Settings' button:Click the 'Settings' button under 'In-Game Overlay' or press Alt+Z:Click 'Keyboard shortcuts':Scroll down untill you reach the 'Record' section and the 'Toggle manual recording on/off and save' option in it:If the field is empty, simply click on it and assign any hotkey of your choice (the default is Shift+F9):Click 'Done' and that's it!\n\t",

This way, everything that is displayed on your monitor will be recorded (regardless of being in game or out of it).Please update video card driver or change selected video encoderThis error message will appear when your driver for the selected encoder is out of date.If you are using one of the hardware based encoders (Nvidia NVENC, AMD AMF, or Intel Quick Sync) please update your drivers accordingly.For Nvidia drivers, click hereFor AMD drivers, click hereFor Intel Quick Sync, click here*Make sure to perform a full system restart after installing the updates, otherwise the changes will not be applied and the error will persist.Additionally, please check that your graphic card meets the minimum recording requirements.Selected video settings are too high. Please lower the settings and retryThis error message will appear when your selected combination of Codec/Preset/Resolution/FPS settings is too demanding for your computer (lack of PC resources).Please try lowering the settings to find the optimal selection for your PC.If possible, we advise using one of the hardware encoders (Nvidia NVENC, AMD AMF, or Intel Quick Sync) as this will free up some computer resources and allow higher quality recording in some cases.Can’t write video to file / Can't create videos foldeThis error message will appear when Overwolf has no permissions to create or add files at the target location. To fix this error you will need to completely uninstall Overwolf and re-install it: How to Re-Install Overwolf with a Clean Slate.If possible make sure to create a backup of your recording files before uninstalling Overwolf.Recording not supported in this gameThis error message will appear when your current game is not supported by Overwolf or is supported by Overwolf but recording is disabled for it.Please check the supported games list which will show you which games are supported, and which games have recording disabled in them. If your game does not appear on that list or has recording disabled, please vote for your game to be supported or post on our forums for assistance.Another possible explanation is that the game you are trying to record runs on a DirectX 8 (DX8) render type, which is not supported by Overwolf.Insufficient hard drive space. Free up space or change target driveThis error message will appear when the hard drive specified in your video recorder settings has no more room to store additional files. To fix this error you can:Free up space by deleting or moving files from the hard drive to somewhere else (external hard drive, secondary hard drive, etc).Change the location where Overwolf saves the video files. To do this, please click on the wrench icon on the video recorder and under \"Video folder\" click on \"Browse\" or \"Change\" and choose a new destination.No video encoders foundThis error message will appear when Overwolf cannot find a video encoder (hardware or software).To fix this error you will need to completely uninstall Overwolf and re-install it: How to Re-Install Overwolf with a Clean Slate.If possible make sure to create a backup of your recording files before uninstalling Overwolf.If this does not solve the issue, please contact us and we will do our best to assist you!We don't know what happened.

The same goes for Legendary chests, except the minimum is 2000 trophies.Where are the shop offers?A: We recently removed the shop offers at the request of Supercell. They wanted to keep some flexibility in them so they can make it more interesting for the players. It could come back later, we don't know!

    "title": "Common Capture Issues: Overwolf Support",
    "body": "When capturing videos with Overwolf you may encounter certain issues. We've collected several common ones, and added explanations and solutions so you could solve these issues on your own :)Game Highlights and Apps are Currently DownOccasionally you may come across a Tweet or an in-app status message that indicate that highlights and apps are currently down. In this case, your highlights will not be captured automatically, however you can still capture manual videos of the game.You don't need to do anything; this situation will be resolved on it's own. We only ask for your patience until we finish patching things up and bring the highlights and apps back to work!For more information, please visit the following article: Apps and Highlights Status Explanation.Take me to...Stuttering/Lagging/Freezing VideosGPU DriversCodecsPresetsHigh Quality SettingsHardware-accelerated GPU schedulingWindows Game OptionsAMD Ryzen ProcessorSoftware/App CoexistenceSound IssuesSound DriversSound not recorded at allOnly recording input sound, output sounds (game, music, etc.) are missingNot recording friends' voices from DiscordUnsupported Sound Format IssueMicrophone sound only heard from left/rightNVIDIA Broadcast issuesVideos Not Captured At AllGPU DriversSHT Compatibility ModeSwitchable DevicesRecording Minimum Requirements ▾Ransomware Protection Blocking RecordingDPI / Offset IssuesRecordings appearing brighter than in-gameStuttering/Lagging/Freezing VideosGPU DriversIf you're experiencing stuttering (frame loss) in your captured videos, unsynced audio and video, videos freezing on one frame, or no video capturing at all your graphics card's drivers may be out of date.Outdated drivers may prevent your graphics card's encoder from working properly (the encoders are essential for the capturing process), and as a result you might experience different issues with the capturing process.Please make sure that your drivers are up to date by visiting your graphics card's developer's website:AMDNvidia IntelOnce you update your drivers it's important to restart your PC (in order for the changes to be applied) before you try to capture videos again.CodecsThe best capturing results can usually be achieved by selecting a codec that uses your dedicated GPU for the encoding process. Other codecs, mainly the x264, use your CPU.Choosing a CPU based codec often result in faulty videos because the CPU has a hard time running the capturing process in addition to all the other system tasks.The codec can be changed through the recording app settings or Overwolf's Capture settings:If your graphics card's encoder is unavailable (grayed out) despite having the latest drivers, you can take a deeper-effective measure and try a clean driver install.For more information on encoders, please visit the articles in the following category: Codecs.PresetsCertain presets may use more of your systems resources, and result in faulty video recordings. Please make sure to have your preset option set to either \"Default\" or \"Automatic\" and try to record again.High Quality SettingsIf your capturing quality settings (resolution, FPS) are set higher than what your system can handle, it will result in faulty videos. You should try to lower the capturing resolution and FPS before launching the game, and then check if the results have improved.Hardware-accelerated GPU schedulingWindows 10's new version, 2004 (build 19041), includes a new graphics setting: Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling. When turned on, this setting may interfere with Overwolf's OBS-based capture engine and cause various issues with the capturing process and the resulted videos. Turning this setting off can help overcome these issues.Windows 11:If you prefer to keep the Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling enabled, you can try to switch the game's display mode from 'Fullscreen' to 'Windowed'/'Windowed Borderless' in order to eliminate lags/dropped frames.Windows Game OptionsDisabling the following options, through the system settings, can improve the recording:Xbox Game BarBackground recordingGame Mode AMD Ryzen ProcessorIf you have an AMD Ryzen processor, you should try updating your system's BIOS, as we've seen it can solve the issue. You will need to enter your motherboard's manufacturer's website and follow the steps according to your specific motherboard model.Software/App CoexistenceIf you have any other video capturing/streaming software (like Nvidia ShadowPlay/NVIDIA Share/OBS Studio, for instance), streaming process or live wallpaper engine (Such as Lively Wallpaper/Wallpaper Engine) running at the same time as your Overwolf capturing app, this may affect the resulting video, or even prevent Overwolf's app from capturing your gameplay entirely.Please disable or close the relevant software and try to capture your gameplay again with your Overwolf app.Lastly, please make sure that you are not using the recording features of multiple Overwolf apps at the same time as this may cause issues in the recordings. Examples of Overwolf apps with recording features:AvatarBUFFGame CaptureGazoomInsights CaptureMedalNuked.TVOutplayedValorant Tracker (TRN)Replay HUDReplays.lolNvidia G-SYNCPlease note that running Nvidia G-SYNC may also cause issues with recording. You can disable it using the following steps:Right-click on your desktop and click on “Nvidia Control Panel” from the menuClick on the “+” next to DisplaySelect Set up G-SYNCUncheck the box next to Enable G-SYNCSound IssuesSound DriversDifferent sound issues can be the result of outdated sound drivers, so the first thing to make sure of is that you have the most recent drivers installed.You can find Realtek drivers right here, and the drivers for any other audio devices in the manufacturer's website.Sound not recorded at allIf you can't hear any sound at all in your captured videos, you may have one of the following software running and conflicting with Overwolf: Nahimic, Alienware Sound Center or Asus Sonic Radar. Please close them when recording with Overwolf to avoid any issues.Only recording input sound, output sounds (game, music, etc.) are missingIf you have recently updated your Windows OS, and have since been having trouble capturing your system's output sounds, you should try the solution presented here: How “Windows Sonic” Spatial Sound Works.This issue can also be caused due to incompatibility between certain headset models and Overwolf's capture engine.Not recording friends' voices from DiscordIf you have a SteelSeries Arctis or HyperX headset with chat/game sound balance, and you can't hear your friends' voices on Discord in your captured videos (only your own voice and other sounds from your system) you can fix this issue by changing settings in Discord.The SteelSeries Arctis and HyperX headsets are using two different channels to output sound, while Overwolf's capture engine can only record one channel at a time.In order for your friends' voices to be recorded too, you will need to open up Discord's settings window, go to \"Voice & Video\", and change the \"Output Device\" to \"Arctis 7 Game\" or \"HyperX [Model Name] Game\":Unsupported Sound Format IssueWhen trying to use any of Overwolf's video recording apps with a specific sound format, you may encounter an error that says \"Unsupported sound format issue\". This issue may occur when using some kind of USB headset/microphone or a webcam microphone, and to solve it you should change the Default Format setting of your playback/recording device to \"Tape Recorder\".Microphone sound only heard from left/rightIf the sound recorded from your microphone can only be heard from one side (left or right), please check your microphone's channel setting:Right-click the speaker icon in your task barSelect 'Recording devices'Right-click your microphone from the list of devicesSelect 'Properties'Go to 'Advanced'Under 'Default Format' make sure the option '1 channel, 16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality)' is selectedClick 'Apply' and 'OK', and try to record your gameplay againNVIDIA Broadcast issuesPlease note that using NVIDIA Broadcast may cause audio issues when recording.Additionally, enabling the NVIDIA Broadcast Noise Removal feature will remove all game noise effects.Videos Not Captured At AllGPU DriversIf your gameplay videos are not being captured at all, you should first check whether your graphics card's drivers are up to date.Outdated drivers may prevent your graphics card's encoder from working properly (the encoders are essential for the capturing process), and as a result you might experience different issues with the capturing process.Please make sure that your drivers are up to date by visiting your graphics card's developer's website:AMDNvidia IntelOnce you update your drivers it's important to restart your PC (in order for the changes to be applied) before you try to capture videos again.SHT Compatibility ModeIf your videos only show black frames, and you have both an integrated GPU and a dedicated GPU, please enable the 'Shared texture compatibility mode' option in Overwolf's capture settings:Switchable DevicesHaving switchable devices in your systems means that different programs can run on different graphics cards (usually the integrated one or the dedicated one).When Overwolf's capture engine is running on one graphics card, and the game is running on the other - it can result in a black screen capture, or no videos being captured at all.The solution is to set Overwolf's capture engine to run on your dedicated graphics card, the same one that the game is running on. This is how you can do that:Legacy:NvidiaRecording Minimum Requirements ▾The following are the minimum requirements for recording with Overwolf apps (having a setup with lower specs may cause issues):Intel CPU: Intel i3 processors that support the Intel Quick Sync encoder. For the supported processors list, click here.AMD CPU: AMD Ryzen processors that support the AMF encoder (integrated Vega graphics unit).*OR*GPU: Versions of Nvidia graphics cards that support the NVENC encoder (GT/M versions might not work).Users with AMD graphics cards can try the AMF encoder, check the supported cards here.RAM: 8GB or more of RAM (16GB recommended!)For more information, please visit the following article: Overwolf Recording Minimum Requirements.Ransomware Protection Blocking RecordingWhen the Windows Ransomware Protection is enabled it may block Overwolf apps from recording. You can test if Windows Ransomware Protection is blocking Overwolf by temporarily disabling it under the Windows Security settings:If disabling the Windows Ransomware Protection resolves the issue you can click on \"Protected folder\" and set your media folder as an exception or set the media folder to an unprotected folder. If you are using Outplayed you can change the media folder using this guide: How to change the Outplayed Media folder DPI / Offset IssuesDoes the app's overlay look too big in-game? Is your cursor mislocated from where you actually click?These issues could be the result of having your DPI set higher than 100%, and the solution is setting it back to that scale in the display settings of Windows. To find out how you can change your DPI setting, please visit the following article: How to Scale down your DPI.Another option that cause an offset is the system's text size. To change it, please open the system settings > 'Ease of Access' > 'Display', and lower the text size to minimum.Recordings appearing brighter than in-gameIf your recordings are appearing brighter than the game please verify that any HDR setting has been disabled and restart the computer.If you are running an AMD graphic card please verify that the \"10-Bit Pixel Format\" setting is disabled and that the computer has been restarted: \n\t",

What do you want to know?What is an Overlay, and How do I Make it Work?Creating an Overwolf AccountOverwolf's AppstoreVideo CapturingWhat is an Overlay, and How do I Make it Work?An overlay is essentially a \"layer\", that can be used to display windows and other elements on top of a game, and can be turned on and off according to your wants and needs, without affecting the game itself. You can read more about it right here.In order to have Overwolf's overlay ready for use with the game that you're playing, please open up Overwolf's settings window, and make sure that:The game appears on the listThe game's overlay option is enabledIs everything set correctly but you're still having trouble getting the overlay to work? Please check out our Overlay Troubleshooting guide.RegistrationWe recommend logging into Overwolf to be able to review apps and to subscribe to them.

    "title": "Performance Issues (FPS, CPU, Memory): Overwolf Support",
    "body": "If you're experiencing any performance issues with your game, that are related to the system's FPS, CPU or memory, and you suspect it might be related to Overwolf, please have a look at the following list of causes and solutions:Take me to...Outdated DriversVideo CapturingRivaTuner Statistics ServerMouse Polling/Report RateMinimum RequirementsOutdated DriversFirst and foremost, it's important to make sure that your drivers are up to date. This includes your:Graphics card's driversSound driversWindows OSIf you install any drivers updates, you should restart your PC in order for the changes to be applied.Video CapturingIf you're using any Overwolf apps that capture videos of your gameplay, it's possible that the capturing process is causing performance issues.The process of capturing videos of your gameplay uses different system resources; RAM, CPU and GPU. These same resources are also responsible for running your game. This is why some effect on the game's FPS can be expected, but it's usually very minor and unnoticeable.In case you're experiencing a significant effect on your game's performance, it's best to make sure that:Your system meets the minimum capturing requirementsYour graphics card's drivers are up to dateYou have the correct codec set in Overwolf's capture settingsYour encoding preset is set to \"Default\" or \"Automatic\"Your FPS and resolution capturing settings are not set too high (according to your system's specs)You don't have any other video capturing/streaming programs running at the same time, like OBS or Nvidia ShadowPlayRivaTuner Statistics ServerRivaTuner Statistics Server is a software that usually comes bundled with the MSI Afterburner. It can conflict with Overwolf when both are running at the same time, and result in significant performance issues, game crashes and Overwolf crashes as well.No worries, though - you can follow the suggested solutions in our \"Overwolf and Conflicts with RivaTuner\" article, to resolve the conflict and have both Overwolf and RivaTuner running at the same time without any interruptions.Mouse Polling/Report RatePolling Rate (or Report Rate) is the at which data is transferring from the mouse to the system, and can be usually set up through the device's software (like Logitech G HUB, CORSAIR iCUE, Razer Synapse, etc.).We've found that in some cases, high polling/report rates (starting from 500Hz and higher) may cause performance issues (dropping FPS, mostly) that can seem to be related to overlays in general or to Overwolf's overlay specifically.We have found that in some cases the issue is resolved by installing the latest chipset drivers, according to your motherboard.Minimum RequirementsWe try to keep it simple, but there are some minimum requirements in order to run Overwolf properly:Operating System: Minimum: Windows 10 (64-bit) / Windows 11 (64-bit)*Windows 7 is no longer supported. It may still work for you, but please note that we will not be able to provide support in case you encounter any issues when running Overwolf on this operating system.  350MB on your hard driveIn-game support: DirectX 8, DirectX 9, DirectX 11, DirectX12 and OpenGLMicrosoft .NET Framework 4.8CPU:Minimum: Intel or AMD quad-core CPU Recommend: Intel i3/i5/i7 Gen7 CPU or AMD Ryzen 1Gen with 3 GHz or higher frequencyRAM: Minimum: 8GBRecommend: 16GBIf your system specs are below these requirements, it is most likely that it's not strong enough to handle Overwolf, and running it may result in performance issues.Still having trouble?

Then set the Outplayed webcam settings to \"OBS Virtual Camera\" and your avatar should appear after clicking on \"Start Virtual Camera\" in OBS:Outplayed does not fully support virtual webcams such as OBS Studio, NVIDIA Broadcast and others. They may work in the preview however we are unable to provide further support regarding virtual cameras.How to capture only game soundOutplayed can be set to capture only the game sound. Using this setting means that your music, voice chat, or any other non-game sounds will not be recorded.You can find the \"System sound captures only the game\" setting in the Outplayed Capture settings under the Audio Advanced options:Please note that this setting is in beta and will not work if you are using a Windows version older then Windows 10 2004 (released 2020-05-27) or Outplayed games with no in-games overlay support.Note: When this setting is enabled it is not possible to record the Valorant voice chat as it is run through the Riot client and not the game process.How to force microphone capture to monoIf you are using an XLR microphone or any microphone that captures only one side you can set Outplayed to mono sound capture under the advanced options in the Outplayed Capture settings:How to set up Wave Link Stream (Elgato Wave) in OutplayedUnder the Outplayed Capture settings go to the Audio section and select the microphone device \"Wave Link Stream (Elgato Virtual Audio)\".

Additionally, it is automatically disabled for games with no in-game overlay support.What are “Before duration” and “After duration”The \"before duration\" is the amount of time Outplayed will record before pressing on the record hotkey. For example, if your before duration is 20 seconds once you press on your hotkey to record Outplayed will record for 20 seconds from before you press on the hotkey. Same goes for after duration, it will continue recording for the amount of time after pressing on the record hotkey.For example, if you click on record 1 minute into your game the recording will start from 0:40 not 1:00 when you click on the hotkey.Once you have changed this setting you can click on \"Apply globally to all games\" if you would like all your games recorded with Outplayed to use the same “Before duration” and “After duration”:When using the Full Session/Full Match Capture Modes the before duration setting refers to placing the bookmark. How to change the duration of your highlightsWhen selecting the Highlights Capture Mode you can set how long before and after each game event you would like each highlight to be captured for. It is possible to set the highlight to be captured for a maximum of 180 seconds before & after each game event.Note: When your game is set to record the Full Session/Full Match these settings can be used to change the length of the bookmark instead of the recording.You can change this setting by clicking on your game under the Games tab, clicking on Advanced Options and toggling the bars next to each event type:For example: In the gif above the settings for the Victory event have been changed so the highlight recorded by Outplayed will show 93 seconds before the Victory event takes place and 92 seconds after the event as well.Please make sure to restart Outplayed and your game to save any changes to these settings.What is a bookmark?Just like bookmarks in real life, creating a bookmark in Outplayed allows you to go back to the point you marked in the video.Bookmarks are represented by an icon on the timeline.

This capability already exists in all BI dashboards through our platform, and any user can create and save as many pre-defined favorite views as needed for his dashboards.Of course, the views a user save, are only visible to that user. However, the Papaya BI team can provide you with the ability to save views that will apply to all users. Below is a short and simple guide How to create a favorite BI ViewSelect all of your filters (for example: show only projects with payroll service), click on “View: Original” button at the top toolbar.2.  In the form, name your favorite view and save it. If you want this view to always appear first as you log-in to that dashboard, check the “make it my default” box.Next time you log in to that report, and click the “View: Original” button, you can select your favorite view and automatically apply all your favorite selections.",
